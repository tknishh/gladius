Here's a new all fresh and insightful compilation of stats for
the generative AI industry. ( https://simplero.com/d/Ch5w9DcAgPecQFSV/c/5782047/5 )

The Gen AI industry is experiencing explosive growth, driven by
significant

* market expansion

* substantial investment, and

* increasing business adoption

across key regions and sectors.

Here's the top 10 stats as a teaser for you
-------------------------------------------

* The global generative AI market was valued at nearly $45
billion in 2023, and is expected to be worth more than $200
billion by 2030 (+361%).

* The generative AI industry generated nearly $67 million in
revenue in 2023 – up more than two-thirds (68%) from 2022.

* Around two-fifths (41%) of the global generative AI market is
based in North America – the most of any region.

* More than two-thirds (68%) of generative AI users had used the
software to ask a question – the highest number of any task.

* Nearly two-thirds (64%) of business leaders feel a high urgency
to adapt to generative AI. (we agree!)

* Over a third (34.7%) of millennials used generative AI at least
once a month in 2023. But 70% of Gen-Z have!

* Almost three-fifths (59%) of men said they used generative AI
in 2024, compared to just over half (51%) of women.

* Less than two-fifths (37%) of marketers used generative AI to
assist with daily work tasks in 2023 – the most of any industry.

* More than two-fifths (44%) of businesses surveyed in 2023
expect generative AI to reduce their workforce in the following
three years.

Let that last one sink in.

Almost half of all businesses expect to reduce their workforce!
