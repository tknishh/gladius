The key to building an enterprise data platform is how you prepare for when they do. So: we've introduced three new concepts for building bulletproof workflows","Inevitably, scheduled DAGs will fail. The key to building an enterprise data platform is how you prepare for when they do.

So: we’ve introduced three new concepts for building bulletproof workflows.

********************************
Metrics, triggers, and incidents
********************************

Prefect can help you create a reliable data platform. Build bulletproof workflows by defining performance with metrics, taking automated action with triggers, and triaging & repairing disruptions with incidents.

-------
Metrics
-------

Metrics calculate how your workflows are performing: think average lateness or duration. With them, assess the success of your workflows, individually or at scale. Use metrics to measure workflows performance, automatically take action, and quantify the impact of your team.

--------
Triggers
--------

Triggers are events that fire when metrics hit a user-defined threshold. Use them with automations to take any action when a triggering event happens. From individual flow performance to application-wide SLAs, you can automatically start recovery and notify the right people.

---------
Incidents
---------

Incidents for when things go wrong - manage your workflow disruptions with the new incidents object. Detect outages sooner, recover faster with automatic remediation, and ensure you’re capturing and communicating the root cause and any actions taken.

I hope you are keeping well.

Here at AIPRM we're still busy taking off the rough edges of
AIPRM Cockpit ( https://simplero.com/d/zuCOLCXp2Xep4ZsT/c/5419449/0 ) and making it grow from a
prototype to a production ready solution for 10,000s of users at
scale, in our well known quality. Our team is working heavily on
improvements for weeks and we even had to redo some major parts
of the prototype to make it production ready.

Here is the waiting list where we let the first AIPRM Elite users
in, as soon as we deem it stable and production ready.

Join AIPRM Cockpit Waiting List ( https://mailing.aiprm.com/subscriptions/CqSZbxHqDAe8wRPE9YyWorgf )

plan, which will give you access to AIPRM Cockpit.

You get the best deal, when you buy for a year.

Why get AIPRM Elite, in addition to getting access to AIPRM

ABOUT THE HOSTS

Filip Justić, Co-Founder & Head of Design at BB Agency

As an agency owner, self-taught designer, and continuous self-optimizer, Filip has spent the last decade honing his design mastery, management skills, and helping our clients uncover the value of design.

When he’s not obsessing over pixels, he’s likely to be found watching the latest indie movies, anime series, or a good NBA game. But make no mistake, design is his true passion, and he’s dedicated to helping others understand that creativity is something we all have within us.

 

Vicente Reyes Montealegre, Graphic Designer and Illustrator & Brand Design Team Lead at BB Agency

Vicente is a graphic designer and illustrator who helps people define, design, and bring their stories to life. He’s worked for various brands in publishing, culture, and tech to create work that informs as much as inspires. He currently supports BB Agency in leading their branding team and helping businesses build strong identities.

Good news! We recently shipped a big new feature. It's called
""Checks,"" and it helps you use AI to polish your sentences until

Here's a video of me showing how it works:

) to skip to the part where I demo checks.)

To give it a try, head over to https://lex.page, open a document
(or create a new one), then click ""Commands"" then ""Run checks.""
We'd love to hear what you think!

Also, before I go, a quick question:

Are you using Lex inside a company? Is it your job to review
drafts that writers send you? We'd love to explore building
custom AI for you to make your life easier. The goal is to learn
what ""good"" looks like in your context, and can help writers get
their drafts into better shape faster, while reducing load and
stress placed on the bottleneck (usually a reviewer / editor of
some sort). From our early testing, we believe it can be useful
for marketers, academics, investors, and beyond. Click here to

 Tanishq
– it’s Nick Singh from DataLemur / Ace the DS Interview.

Have you seen Zach Wilson's INSANE 7-year journey from $30k Data Science intern to $575k at Airbnb as Lead Data Engineer?

Pretty amazing, right?

One guy's comment on the post caught my eye, and is the inspiration for today's email on 5 uncomfortable truths for tech careers.

But first, the dude's salty comment👇

In my reply to his salary woes, I mention Cost of Living & WLB (work-life balance) as possible reasons for why this dude's title is Senior/Staff but he's making Facebook Junior Data Eng money ($170k):

BRO was not having it 👇
I strongly believe this guy's way of thinking is holding him back.

Sadly, his thought process is too common, and might be holding you back your tech career too.


** Is vs. Should Be
------------------------------------------------------------

Dude's frustrated with how things work, thinking geographic pay disparities are a corporate ploy, rather than a direct consequence of how talent markets differ city to city, and country to country.

Dude's frustrated that prioritizing work-life balance has an impact on salaries, rather than acknowledge the 60-hour weeks Zach worked for years in a row to grow so fast.

To truly get ahead in our tech career, we've got to understand how the world is  – not complain about how the world should be.

That means embracing some uncomfortable truths about tech careers if you want to make more money in tech.


** 5 Uncomfortable Tech Career Truths 🙃
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Work in high-cost-of-living places like SF or NYC. Companies pay more in these big tech/finance hubs, because the competition for employees is fierce here, and many of these companies don't want remote employees.

Though taxes are ~5-15% higher, and houses are ~2-3x more expensive, you could easily earn 2-10x more if you network with others IRL and job hop to breakout companies every few years.

2. Focus on working in the profit center, not the cost center of the business. Align yourself with the money to make more money.

3. Data Science/ML isn't a profit center at many companies. So, seek out companies where their bread & butter is Data/ML.

Example: Character.AI is hiring for 16 open roles (https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/character) , including their first Data Scientist (https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/character/ca4e2009-7c71-481c-bccd-b2c70dd0c420) , tons of SWE/ML people (https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/character/13006848-6a69-4467-9274-5d54e80b965d) , and even Front End Engineers & Data Engineers too.

Their CEO invented the Transformer (the ‘T’ in GPT) and they’ve raised $150M from top VCs.
https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/character
Working at a genAI company like Character (https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/character) will help you progress your data/ML skills much faster than working at a F500 ""innovation lab"" where it takes 3 months to ship a simple logistic regression model to prod.

4. To get promoted, take on visible projects and knock them out of the park.

Don't be shy about showcasing your successes to stakeholders and executives.

Too many techies underestimate the power of self-promotion. Yes, it can feel icky, but visibility matters 🤷.

5. Putting more hours into your career is the most reliable way to grow your skills/income faster.

There are no shortcuts. More hot takes on working hard vs. working smart here (https://us19.campaign-archive.com/?u=11fa1ee9c20a64044db2d61ba&id=a563407cad) .

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So, there you have it…Some truths to embrace if you want to make more money in your tech career.

Remember, it's easier to change yourself than to change the world.

As you may be aware, AIPRM has always strived to provide exceptional service and a","Hi Tanishq

We would like to inform you about some important updates
regarding the use of private prompts in AIPRM.

As you may be aware, AIPRM has always strived to provide
exceptional service and a seamless experience for our users. In
line with our commitment to maintaining a fair and sustainable
platform, we have recently enforced the private prompt limits as
outlined in the plans introduced in March 2023.

For a significant period, nearly a year since our inception, we
allowed early users the flexibility to exceed the private prompt
usage limits for existing prompts without needing to upgrade
their plan. This was our way of thanking you for your early
support and trust in our service. However, to ensure the
longevity and quality of our services, we've had to align with
the original plan specifications.

If you've noticed that some of your private prompts are no longer
visible, it's likely a result of these recent adjustments.

This change is particularly relevant if there has been a
cancellation or downgrade in your subscription.

In such cases, the access to private prompts is now aligned with
your current plan's limitations.

We understand that this transition might be an inconvenience to
some, and we sincerely apologize for any disruption this may
cause in your workflow.

Our team is dedicated to supporting you through this adjustment.
If you find that your current plan no longer meets your needs, we
encourage you to consider the different plans we offer, which are
designed to cater to a range of usage requirements.

Your feedback and satisfaction are incredibly important to us. If
you have any questions, concerns, or need assistance in choosing
a plan that best fits your needs, please don't hesitate to reach
out to our customer support team.

Here's our official FAQ page with details. ( https://simplero.com/d/Bw1FeXhiXKLHhl4v/c/5374744/0
)

We are here to help and ensure that your experience with AIPRM
continues to be productive and enjoyable.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.

MOZILLIANS IN THE NEWS                                        

Mozilla CEO Mitchell Baker interviewed by Forbes                                                        Watch 'On Lessons From Netscape For Ethical AI' to learn how we're working towards open source ethics on the needle-mover of the moment.

""We believe that society should play a role in essentially life and how internet technology impacts life and how to regulate it in a way that doesn't uniquely benefit the big players and harm open-source efforts.""

------------------------------------
Just released: interactive workflows
------------------------------------

Interacting with workflows at runtime opens up a world of possibilities:
* Human-in-the-loop workflows, such as approval or review
* Branching logic (for example, choose what infra to run on)
* AI/LLM interactions
* Continuous data streams
But, trying to introduce dynamic input at runtime for any workflow can be difficult:

* Need to host an API
* Need to build a UI
* Need to run/rent a database

Walk through this guide ( https://www.prefect.io/blog/unveiling-interactive-workflows?utm_campaign=Full+Broadcast+1%2F30&utm_content=Cloud+Broadcast&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=email ) for a human-in-the-loop process using Prefect, with native form support and a hosted API so that all you need to worry about is defining the input you expect from your humans.

Keep the party going and try to host another party together next week, or even sooner!

 

Here are some ideas for your next party:
 


- Have fun! Show your flair and send your friends lots of messages, emojis, reactions and GIFs 
- Make it memorable! After the video is over, take 5 minutes to chat about the show, share other cool videos, and talk about life 🙂 
- If scheduling is tricky, try to watch a movie instead of a TV show. It's usually much easier to coordinate 😏 
- If you really want to go for a challenge, try watching an entire season of a show together. You can use our long party feature to watch multiple episodes. 
- If you ever get bored, switch videos and try another show or another service! Teleparty makes it easy to change videos mid-party and works with a growing list of 15+ streaming services.
  
Happy hosting!

<sirdonaldfrancesco015@gmail.com>,Nick Singh <hello@nicksingh.com>,my GF hates me 💔 [Tech Career Advice],2024-01-26 20:22:02+05:30,Tanishq a painful truth about Tinder & tech jobs Tanishq – it's Nick Singh from DataLemur / Ace the DS Interview here to air out my dirty laundry: 💔 My girlfriend hates me because I tell her,"Tanishq a painful truth about Tinder & tech jobs
 Tanishq
– it’s Nick Singh from DataLemur / Ace the DS Interview here to air out my dirty laundry:

💔 My girlfriend hates me because I tell her she’s NOT special 💔

She’s a full-time Data Analyst who’s simultaneously searching for a new job, and she'll complain to me about problems like:

“I applied to 30 jobs but only got 1 interview”

""This open job has senior analyst expectations, but junior analyst pay”

“I can’t find time to study for interviews due to my hectic schedule”

I constantly remind her she’s not special, everyone has these issues, and she HATES hearing that.

(yes, I get it, she’s looking for sympathy, wants to feel heard, etc.)

But that's not going to stop me from ranting about:
* why the “✨I’m special✨” mindset is detrimental
* why thinking your NOT being special is a GOOD thing for tech careers
* 5 amazing career advice resources from different leaders in tech that'll help 98.9% of people (regardless of their unique backgrounds)




** Special Snowflake Syndrome ❄️
------------------------------------------------------------

Growing up in 90s America, I had motivational posters like this one in most of my classrooms:

My teachers taught me that there were different “learning styles”... and that we all learn uniquely.

They told me that Kyle, my middle-school bully, isn’t dumb because he’s in 8th grade and can’t read and write… he’s just a musical auditory learner who's actually a genius because he can play the guitar.

Fast forward to 2023, and psychologists have debunked all this “my brain learns differently” nonsense, and my bully / auditory genius classmate Kyle works the Taco Bell drive thru.
We’re not all special snowflakes, who learn in our own unique ways.

We’re not all special snowflakes, with unique personalities & interests.

(swipe on Tinder for 2 minutes to see how “unique” your passion for dogs / the office / tacos / pizza / traveling are)
Similarly, you’re not a special snowflake with totally unique career challenges!

I know this from having done hundreds of 1:1 career coaching sessions (https://ace-the-data-science-interview.teachable.com/?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=gf-hates-me) with people from a variety of backgrounds, ages, and countries – it all boils down to the same struggles:
* How do I find a career that I’ll love
* How do I build the specific skills needed for my dream career
* How do I convince others to give me that interview / job / promotion


** You’re Not Special and that’s GOOD
------------------------------------------------------------

Knowing you're not facing special problems is an EMPOWERING mindset to have when you're grinding on the job hunt or trying to climb the career  ̶l̶a̶d̶d̶e̶r̶ jungle gym (https://us19.campaign-archive.com/?u=11fa1ee9c20a64044db2d61ba&id=0dac96d184) .

Realizing your career struggles aren't special means:
* you’re more open to learning from other’s experiences and wisdom, rather than discounting their advice because their journey doesn’t exactly match up to your own
* you’re less likely to have unrealistic expectations for learning & career growth, which will save you a ton of frustration and make you more patient
* you’ll be more receptive to hearing how others faced similar challenges and overcame them, which will provide you comfort and help you be resilient during difficult times


**
Career Advice I Love ❤️
------------------------------------------------------------

So, now that you hopefully realize that your career struggles might not be so unique, here’s some general career advice from different tech leaders that you NEED to read:
* Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice (https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/) : written by Patrick McKenzie, a programmer who now runs Product/Corporate Strategy at Stripe, there’s career tips for all tech people… not just software engineers
* How to Do What You Love (http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html) : realistic advice on finding your calling from programmer turned legendary VC, Paul Graham
* Career Moats 101 (https://commoncog.com/career-moats-101/) : a series of essays on how to maintain competitive advantage over your career competition and protect your long term career prospects
* Startup of You (https://amzn.to/3JIhpKt) : book by Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn Founder), on how to approach your career like a startup approaches company building
* How to Get Rich without Getting Lucky (https://mcdonnellcallum.medium.com/naval-ravikant-how-to-get-rich-without-getting-lucky-e8d32bba14d1) : AngelList founder, Naval Ravikant's tweet storm on building massive leverage through code, content, and capital

https://amzn.to/3JIhpKt
Reply and let me know which resource above resonated with you the most!

Till next time my not-so-special snowflakes ❄️,

Nick Singh

* Interactive workflows: running jobs can accept typed inputs ( https://prefec.tv/4b4X2TJ?utm_campaign=Interactive+workflows+and+more+launch&utm_content=Cloud+Broadcast&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=email ), which can be provided programmatically or manually via forms, enabling human-in-the-loop workflows

* Modal integration: new work pool type for Modal, with it’s blazing fast spin-up
* Performance metrics: Aggregated views of events that give you an overall assessment of your platform, such as average duration or lateness
* Incident management: declare incidents ( https://docs.prefect.io/latest/cloud/incidents/?utm_campaign=Interactive+workflows+and+more+launch&utm_content=Cloud+Broadcast&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=email ), collaborate on investigations and take automated action to recover from downtime faster

What can you do with interactive workflows? A lot of surprising new things. Set up approvals for specific flows, create flows with manual, at-runtime inputs, or build flow to flow interactions.

Prefect-managed compute and the Modal work pool can help you get into production without ever having to worry about configuring infrastructure.

Incidents and metrics allow you to enforce SLAs, automatically take action, and manage outages until they are resolved.

Trying to solve a complex problem or question, but struggling to find the insights you need? I’m going to make a bold statement here, so stay with me: You’re thinking about your data all wrong. Or rather, your database doesn’t let you think about data the way you need to.

With many systems built on relational databases, you may not know that there’s a better option for complex problems: graph databases <https://message.neo4j.com/NzEwLVJSQy0zMzUAAAGQvuf-bFrMi_koBwEXPgjQzlA_-ULHthmULII93q_NDNAdzmAmq6maOy9hbfm7o6Lcyj4vYlw=>. Ironically, relational databases aren’t effective at handling data relationships <https://message.neo4j.com/NzEwLVJSQy0zMzUAAAGQvuf-bONJ0MD9GUaP-VGfNqGakBZuQZwqAY7ByPLgVz-2Q-1P1RamP9FKCpHOmbWdXBgoSFw=>, which means they don’t work as well for problems involving behavior and interactions over time.

A relational database works well when you’re listing transactions – like bank deposits and withdrawals. But you’d want a graph database for capturing any relationships in the data – like the relationships between a household and all their banking products.

-------------
Why not Cron?
-------------

Running a recurring task automatically sounds like a job for scheduling, right? Although your reflex might be to reach for cron, *running* the script is really only the first of several problems you'll encounter:

* Error handling when upstream errors are out of your team's control
* Debugging an error and assessing the impact on its dependencies
* Speed of execution and systematically parallelizing tasks
* Not losing historical data of task output used in reports
Hear about how these five problems manifest themselves and how to solve them with Prefect 👉here ( https://www.prefect.io/blog/schedule-python-scripts-solving-five-problems-scaling?utm_campaign=Full+Broadcast+1%2F17&utm_content=Cloud+Broadcast&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=email )👈.

--------------------
Security comes first
--------------------

We're a startup, but we still meet Fortune 100 customer compliance standards. We do this in a few new ways:
*
Dedicated hosting options: can't use multi-tenant SaaS offerings? No problem. We recently released two options - a dedicated single tenant version of Prefect Cloud hosted by us, or a fully self-hosted version by you, with all the bells and whistles of Cloud included. Read more about these offerings 👉here ( https://www.prefect.io/enterprise?utm_campaign=Full+Broadcast+1%2F17&utm_content=Cloud+Broadcast&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=email )👈.
*
Compliance: maintaining good standing in SOC 2 compliance. As we told Thoropass ( https://www.prefect.io/security?utm_campaign=Full+Broadcast+1%2F17&utm_content=Cloud+Broadcast&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=email ) - our compliance solution - we don't have back and forth with procurement teams at even the largest companies. It just works.

---------------------------------------
Last but not least: asking for feedback
---------------------------------------

We would not be anywhere without our users. Our ability to build an amazing product rests on understanding the various ways Prefect is used.

🙋 The ask: please take 3 minutes of your day to fill out our user survey here ( https://forms.gle/dXCyoPv1iPD1C3TFA?utm_campaign=Full+Broadcast+1%2F17&utm_content=Cloud+Broadcast&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=email ).

From Concentric Circles to Universal Lines: The Evolution of the Modern Barcode
From Concentric Circles to

Universal Lines: The

Evolution of the Modern

Barcode

 
The familiar barcode was nearly a bull's-eye design conceived in 1949 by Woodland and Silver. Their initial circular pattern diverged from the linear form we know today. This design evolution was influenced by technological advancements and the grocery industry's pursuit of a standardized barcode. The eventual adoption of IBM's linear barcode design over the original bull's-eye pattern marked a significant turning point in retail and technology history.

The Barcode That Almost Was 🎯 A Tale of Bulls-Eyes and Business Battles

In the late 1940s, the barcode's journey began with a radically different design from what we know today. Originally envisioned as a series of concentric circles by inventors Woodland and Silver, this bull's-eye pattern was the first step in a transformative journey. The barcode's evolution was propelled by advancements in laser technology and the need for a universal system in the retail industry.

The shift from the circular to the linear design resulted from intense competition and deliberation, notably between RCA's bull's-eye and IBM's linear design. The final decision to adopt IBM's version, influenced by various factors, including industry pressures and practical considerations, has had a lasting impact on commerce and technology, making barcodes an integral part of our daily transactions and logistics. The barcode story shows how innovation, industry needs, and strategic decisions shape technological evolution.

This move highlights the brand's commitment to natural ingredients, contrasting with other brands leveraging AI in marketing. The campaign features limited-edition packaging and a chance to win a trip to Florida. Tropicana's stance is a creative response to the increasing influence of AI in popular culture.

 Tanishq
– if you want a kick-ass career in tech, you need to think about your career non-linearly.

Before I share stories of Data Scientists and Software Engineers at Airbnb & Spotify who followed non-linear career paths, let’s analyze Sheryl Sandberg’s weird journey to Facebook COO.

In 2000, Sheryl worked as Chief of Staff to Larry Summers at the US Treasury Department – a job which had nothing to do with tech/advertising/sales.

However, In 2001, Google CEO Eric Schmidt was impressed by her intellect, so tried to recruit her.

Sheryl for the longest time was reluctant to join this small startup because it looked like a step DOWN for her.

In hindsight, she’s glad she made the leap: she crushed the Google job, became VP of Ads, and grew her org from 4 to 4,000 employees in six short years 🚀.

Then, Zuck poached her to become COO at Facebook, which is how she got her net-worth of $1.8 billion.

It’s wild to think that her switch into tech almost didn’t happen because of her preconceived notions about climbing a traditional career ladder.

That’s why she now preaches about the career jungle gym:

The path forward in your career might not be straight ahead; we need to be open to a sideways move, maybe even a step back, to ultimately realize our full potential.

This is known as swinging in the career jungle gym, or following the career lattice (rather than climbing the corporate ladder).


** Non-Linear Path Advantages
------------------------------------------------------------

Non-linear career paths, while circuitous and stressful, have two big advantages:

#1 - Non-Linearity Builds Resilience 💪

Non-linear paths force you to get comfortable with uncertainty and adapting to new work challenges, and overall become mentally tougher.

Simply put, if you take control and f*** up your own career journey with twists and turns, you'll be a lot less scared of layoffs or getting fired because you've dealt with big career changes already.

#2 - Non-Linearity Builds CEO Skills 💼

A non-linear path helps you build the broad range of experiences and skills needed to be a CEO or entrepreneur; something that'll never happen working in one narrow discipline.

This diverse skill set helps you open up new, unexpected paths into the C-suite.



** Non-Linear Paths to Airbnb & Spotify
------------------------------------------------------------
To inspire you, here's some examples of people who've had kick-ass, non-linear careers in tech:

♠️ Hasseeb Qureshi: Poker to Airbnb (https://haseebq.com/about/)

Hasseeb was a top-ranked high stakes professional poker player, then Director of Product at a Startup. After PM, he went to a SWE bootcamp, and ended up working at Coinbase & Airbnb. Now he's managing partner / VC at Dragonfly (a crypto fund).

💇‍♀️ Mikiko Bazeley: Hair Salon to MLOps (https://medium.com/kitchen-sink-data-science/from-hair-salon-to-data-scientist-288c86cabed7)

Miki graduated with a 2.3 GPA and worked as a stylist at a hair salon out of college. Then, she joined a startup as a “Sales Hacker”. From there, she did BizOps, and then transitioned into Data Science at Autodesk & Teladoc. Learning more SWE, she did MLOps at Intuit, and is now Head of MLOps at FeatureForm.

🏋️‍♀️ (https://medium.com/@sydneybang18/how-i-became-an-analytics-engineer-at-spotify-2-years-after-graduating-with-an-exercise-science-e756e9eff6ca) Sydney Bang: Exercise Science to Spotify (https://medium.com/@sydneybang18/how-i-became-an-analytics-engineer-at-spotify-2-years-after-graduating-with-an-exercise-science-e756e9eff6ca)

Sydney went from a degree in Kinesiology to Analytics Engineer at Spotify in just 2 years, by way of working Customer Success at a startup, then being a Data Analyst at Kickstarter.



** My Non-Linear Career 📕
------------------------------------------------------------
I can personally attest to the power of non-linear careers, because I'm lucky enough to have one – but it wasn't always this way!

Starting out my career at Facebook, I had a linear view of careers, and at age 22 I fully expected to just do technical roles at FAANG and collect increasingly bigger paychecks till I chose to retire.

A year into Facebook, after I was sorta burnt out from the job, I decided to YOLO and embrace non-linearity.

I took a BIG pay-cut to join geospatial analytics startup SafeGraph, where I got to do a variety of work across data, marketing, and developer evangelism, and even got to the represent the company on CNN, NPR, and Fox News.
This breadth of work at SafeGraph, combined with my more traditional experience at Facebook, gave me the idea to post tech career advice on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-singh-tech/)  back in 2019.

Getting positive feedback on my career tips from my LI followers nudged me to write my best-selling book Ace the Data Science Interview (https://amzn.to/3kF79Fx) , which then turned into DataLemur.com (https://datalemur.com/questions?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nonlinear-careers)  (a free way to practice for SQL & Python & Data Science interviews).

At 22, I never dreamed of being a full-time author and entrepreneur, but I guess that's the magic of embracing a non-linear career! ✨

Till next time,

Nick Singh

p.s. If you're trying to get a new job in data science / ML / analytics, you NEED to watch my video course “Ace the Data Job Hunt (https://ace-the-data-science-interview.teachable.com/?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nonlinear-careers) ”.

It’s got 25 videos on resumes, portfolio projects, behavioral interviews, and cold email networking, packed with unique tactics you've probably never heard about because I'm not a traditional career coach.

p.p.s. If you need personalized tips on making your way through the career jungle gym, or simply want your resume & LinkedIn critiqued & improved, I offer 1:1 career coaching (https://ace-the-data-science-interview.teachable.com/?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nonlinear-careers) as well (and you get access to the video course for free this way!)

By analysing real-world examples, this article by Fanghua (Joshua) Yu demonstrates several categories where these limitations manifest, leading to inaccuracies in LLM-generated content.

The holiday season might be over…. but our Amazon privacy wish list has been
left untouched.									

Our wish list was long, but we didn’t want to be greedy – so we settled on a
common sense “present” that we could all agree on: for Amazon to protect children’s privacy.									

With home devices, e-readers, and tablets increasingly geared towards kids, Amazon’s ability to mine children’s personal data is a huge problem. And with more and more of these “smart” home products having reached the hands
of children this Christmas, Amazon’s poor privacy practices are unacceptable.									

Fortunately, a new executive is now in charge of Amazon’s Devices & Services division– and together, we need to send him a strong message that protecting children’s
privacy must be a top priority.									

Read the email we sent recently below to learn more about this issue and sign the petition to tell Amazon to respect children’s privacy. https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/E8YjQex9EbH8/RHZFSGNFNmhWR21yaXpBdUpmUVpIaEJxSkY2OWd5MmxwZHh0RlZwbFU4cUNlTno0RVFkcWpjSEQyWmFSdHdFRE5BazJIR2oxTHhsc1d6eDc5VmtqTG5PaGhvTU4rSkVaLzlqRTc5M1BPYVU9S0/ 									Sign the Petition → https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/37~xHR4wr~JL/RHZFSGNFNmhWR21yaXpBdUpmUVpIaEJxSkY2OWd5MmxwZHh0RlZwbFU4cUNlTno0RVFkcWpjSEQyWmFSdHdFRE5BazJIR2oxTHhsc1d6eDc5VmtqTG5PaGhvTU4rSkVaLzlqRTc5M1BPYVU9S0/

Amazon's Alexa is getting a new boss. Let's ask him to protect children's privacy in Amazon devices https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/ZdYRQkEPbzHD/RHZFSGNFNmhWR21yaXpBdUpmUVpIaEJxSkY2OWd5MmxwZHh0RlZwbFU4cUNlTno0RVFkcWpjSEQyWmFSdHdFRE5BazJIR2oxTHhsc1d6eDc5VmtqTG5PaGhvTU4rSkVaLzlqRTc5M1BPYVU9S0/.									

A new executive is coming in to lead Amazon's Devices & Services division, which
includes Alexa, Echo, Ring Video Doorbells, Fire TV, Fire tablets, Kindles, and other devices and ""smart"" home products. And we think he needs to make
protecting people’s privacy a top priority.									

That has to start with children’s privacy. Amazon has agreed to pay a $25
million USD fine to U.S. regulators for keeping Alexa recordings of children's
voices and geolocation data indefinitely - in some cases even after parents had
asked for them to be deleted.With smart home devices, e-readers, and tablets geared towards kids, Amazon's
ability to mine children’s personal data is a big problem.									

This is not acceptable, and we need to make sure we send a strong message to the
new Amazon leadership: Children’s privacy needs to be protected in all Amazon
devices.									

Sign Mozilla’s petition now and tell Amazon's new executive to protect children’s privacy in Amazon devices! https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/xdAYQ7RwVqJw/RHZFSGNFNmhWR21yaXpBdUpmUVpIaEJxSkY2OWd5MmxwZHh0RlZwbFU4cUNlTno0RVFkcWpjSEQyWmFSdHdFRE5BazJIR2oxTHhsc1d6eDc5VmtqTG5PaGhvTU4rSkVaLzlqRTc5M1BPYVU9S0/ 									Sign the Petition  → https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/G4EXHmxgGjHX/RHZFSGNFNmhWR21yaXpBdUpmUVpIaEJxSkY2OWd5MmxwZHh0RlZwbFU4cUNlTno0RVFkcWpjSEQyWmFSdHdFRE5BazJIR2oxTHhsc1d6eDc5VmtqTG5PaGhvTU4rSkVaLzlqRTc5M1BPYVU9S0/ 																		 									

The online shopping giant has never been good at respecting consumers’ privacy.
In Mozilla's *Privacy Not Included holiday shopping guide we published last week, Amazon tops our worst-of list. They do a terrible job at respecting and protecting our privacy on multiple
fronts. And this is the absolute minimum of what Amazon needs to do immediately:									Do not retain voice recordings on Alexa for Kids and other products aimed at children, including audio files, transcripts and geolocation information by default										Honour parents’ requests to delete their children’s personal data										Identify and delete inactive child profiles									

Sign the petition now and ask Amazon to respect children’s privacy! https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/YWg8BZ3y~DJE/RHZFSGNFNmhWR21yaXpBdUpmUVpIaEJxSkY2OWd5MmxwZHh0RlZwbFU4cUNlTno0RVFkcWpjSEQyWmFSdHdFRE5BazJIR2oxTHhsc1d6eDc5VmtqTG5PaGhvTU4rSkVaLzlqRTc5M1BPYVU9S0/ 									

Now that there's a new leader for the Amazon products that go into peoples'
homes, there are big windows of opportunity for:									The new leader of Amazon's hardware division, who can fix the worst privacy problems and start his tenure by showing us that privacy is something Amazon cares about;										Amazon employees, who want to make their products less creepy;										Consumers, who can ask for products that respect everyone’s privacy starting immediately with children.									

Mozilla has been keeping a close eye on Amazon, from reviewing Amazon's products in our buyer's guide for the last six years,
to exposing security issues with Amazon Ring, or the company’s excessive data
sharing with law enforcement. Our Amazon privacy wish list is long, starting
with securing common sense privacy features in kids products.									

We need to keep holding Amazon accountable, and Mozilla supporters across the
world can help. Together, let’s seize this rare opportunity to drive real change in Amazon's
business practices and make sure it keeps its hands off children's personal data.									

Sign the petition and tell Amazon to respect children’s privacy. https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/rjAzQNjk3yC8/RHZFSGNFNmhWR21yaXpBdUpmUVpIaEJxSkY2OWd5MmxwZHh0RlZwbFU4cUNlTno0RVFkcWpjSEQyWmFSdHdFRE5BazJIR2oxTHhsc1d6eDc5VmtqTG5PaGhvTU4rSkVaLzlqRTc5M1BPYVU9S0/ 									Sign the Petition  → https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/vpALQ~we48sN/RHZFSGNFNmhWR21yaXpBdUpmUVpIaEJxSkY2OWd5MmxwZHh0RlZwbFU4cUNlTno0RVFkcWpjSEQyWmFSdHdFRE5BazJIR2oxTHhsc1d6eDc5VmtqTG5PaGhvTU4rSkVaLzlqRTc5M1BPYVU9S0/

Question: How do you prove that 2^100 + 3^100 < 4^100?


Answer from Alon Amit


Much more is true: in fact, [math]3^{100}+3^{100}<4^{100}[/math].

This is the same as saying [math]2\cdot 3^{100}<4^{100}[/math].

That [math]100[/math] in the exponent i

Today is the last (business) day to lock in the old prices for
AIPRM before they go up on Monday, January 8!

I recommend getting AIPRM Elite to

* view the Prompt Source with 1-Click.
* Clone a Prompt for your Own Prompts.
* More lists, private prompts, and custom writing styles. A
second license for your partner.
* And soon AIPRM Cockpit!

* And soon, the ""Custom Index"" feature will feed your knowledge
base or documents to the AI

A word on the Custom Index feature coming up: this will not be
for the proverbial PDF to chat with...

...Custom Index is created from and for hundreds of pages of
documentation or websites for you.

The price for this goes from $79 to $99 on January 8 for new
purchases.

You get the best deal when you buy for a year and lock in the
price.

Take the chance. The image below that says it all.

My recommendation Tanishq:

If you want to go for an AIPRM Premium plan,
then do so soon

and lock in old prices for a year with an annual plan.

SECURE THE OLD PRICE HERE
(but before Jan 8) ( https://simplero.com/d/zzlj6OKx6tMAvOUz/c/5294651/0 )

Have a great day,

If you've already considered upgrading to a paid plan,
then this mail is for you.

AIPRM's prices are going up soon,
on January 8, 2024 - the first birthday of AIPRM.

If you've not yet considered upgrading, this may be important.

If you decided not to purchase a premium plan, that's OK, too,
we still love you! ❤️

This is a kind reminder about the price increase for new paid
accounts.

AIPRM has introduced many new features in the premium plans that
will make your life easier and more productive,
and we're just getting started.

When you look at what AIPRM Cockpit in the Elite plan will have
in store by watching some of the videos here (
https://simplero.com/d/zzlj6OKx6tMAvOUz/c/5294653/2 ), you get an idea.

However, with these new features comes an increase in pricing.

But you still have the opportunity to lock in the early prices
before they're gone.

The best you can do is to buy and prepay an annual plan now, to
lock in the current old price.

This means you can enjoy all the benefits of AIPRM at a lower
cost for as long as you remain a subscriber.

And we would be very thankful for your support.

Here's what you need to know:

* New prices come into effect for new purchases on January 8
2024.

* By subscribing now, you can lock in the current lower prices.

* By subscribing now, you can save yourself quite some money in
the long run.

Here are the current early bird prices for your reference
as listed on our plans page. ( https://simplero.com/d/zzlj6OKx6tMAvOUz/c/5294651/3 )

AIPRM Titan: $899/month
AIPRM Team: $149/month
AIPRM Elite: $79/month
AIPRM Pro: $29/month
AIPRM Plus: $9/month

You can purchase at these prices here after login. (
https://simplero.com/d/zzlj6OKx6tMAvOUz/c/5294651/4 )

Don't wait too long Tanishq
to take advantage of this opportunity.

You can subscribe now and secure your spot before the prices go
up.

Here's a heads-up on the new prices that will be coming into
effect for new purchases from January 8.

AIPRM Titan: $999/month
AIPRM Team: $199/month
AIPRM Elite: $99/month
AIPRM Pro: $33/month
AIPRM Plus: $10/month

If you have any questions or concerns,
please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help.

Thanks & best regards,

The team of AIPRM

P.S. By subscribing now, you can lock in the early bird prices
for as many subscriptions as you wish.

P.P.S all prices are still subject to price indexation per our
terms and so the best deal for you now would be an annual plan.

And what might you find when you do this?

A slew of errors coming from your pipelines in Slack. And so it begins: curing the workflow hangover.

Here's a recap of what we added to Prefect in 2023 that can make you more efficient.

---------------------------------
Understand exactly what's failing
---------------------------------

In 2023, you get a more efficient way to triage workflows.

When you see the dreaded red alarm Slack alert, there's only one question to answer: what happened and why? You need context - enter the Prefect dashboard.

You're most desperate for information from Prefect when execs are pounding on your door about stale data. What you need at your finger tips:
* Which workflows are failing
* Summarized errors (even better with AI) so you know exactly what to fix
* Infrastructure state - if your work pools are down, nothing else matters
* An easy way to look at past errors to ensure you're meeting data SLAs
Even if it's just one task in a flow failing, all downstream tasks will be off. Getting to the bottom of who's affected by an error means a clear view of dependencies that adapt per run as your data changes.

--------------------------
What about infrastructure?
--------------------------

It's easier to get something right the first time - particularly when productionizing - than to do it over again.

In 2023, we really took this mantra to heart by provisioning infrastructure.

After you write code, you need to quickly:
* Provision custom infrastructure, like an ECS cluster, with as little config as possible
* Deploy your code to this infrastructure, like with the new .deploy() method on a flow function
* Make your infrastructure connect to your code remotely, not on your machine
A question remains, to operate lean: how can you spin up infrastructure only when it's needed?

---------------------------
The minimum viable schedule
---------------------------

If there's no data to update, you don't need to run your workflow. Your finance team doesn't need another reason to be on your back about your cloud bill.

Sometimes the minimum viable schedule is no schedule at all.

In 2023, we brought you: events, automations, and webhooks.

Run a workflow only when something actually happens. An event driven pipeline:
* Shouldn't be a black box like a cloud function - alert on lack of executions, handle dependencies, etc.
* Integrated with your other work so you can debug and track dependencies with context
And those were only the highlights of what Prefect shipped i 2023.

* Cron gets complicated and hacky real quick. Orchestration isn't enough anymore - you need an observability platform ( https://www.prefect.io/blog/why-you-need-an-observability-platforY?utm_campaign=Cloud+Broadcast+1%2F3&utm_content=Cloud+Broadcast&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=email ).
Let's get stoked for 2024.

Happy New Year! I am excited to share some fantastic news to start 2024: we reached our goal of raising $3,300,000 USD in grassroots donations from the Mozilla community before the end of 2023!									

Here’s how the Mozilla community came together in the final six weeks of the
year:									An incredible 34,667 of us made a donation to reclaim the internet since Giving Tuesday, including 14,972 who made their first-ever gift to Mozilla;										More than 3,000 of us donated our voices to Mozilla Common Voice, recording more than 90,000 clips to make voice recognition systems more accessible;										And 1,181 of us started a monthly gift to sustain Mozilla’s non-profit work.									

Because of this support from the Mozilla community, we’ll be able to do even
more of what Mozilla does best: holding irresponsible tech companies
accountable, advocating for your privacy, and investing in the people, ideas,
and organisations who will help reclaim the internet.									

Thanks for everything you do for the internet.

Here's a quick reminder about prices for new purchases of AIPRM premium plans going up on Jan 8. Lock in the old price before January 8!","Hey Tanishq

Do you enjoy your winter holidays, like we do?

Here's a quick reminder about prices for new purchases of AIPRM
premium plans going up on Jan 8.

Lock in the old price before January 8!

You get the best deal, when you buy for a year.

Get AIPRM Elite to view the Prompt Source with 1-Click.

Clone them for your Own Prompts. More lists, private prompts, and
custom writing styles. A second license for your partner.

And soon the AIPRM Elite plan includes: AIPRM Cockpit!

Price for this goes from $79 to $99 on January 8 for new
purchases.

Don't miss it.

The image that says it all.

My recommendation Tanishq:

If you want to go for an AIPRM Premium plan,
then do so soon

to lock in old prices for a year with an annual plan.

SECURE THE OLD PRICE HERE
(but before Jan 8) ( https://simplero.com/d/stgTxK2zW2uuRXu9/c/5288965/0 )

Have a great day,

~Christoph

Founder & CEO
AIPRM

Tanishq

Thanks so much for your interest in AIPRM. We hope you like it!

If you've already considered upgrading to a paid plan,
then this mail is for you.

AIPRM's prices are going up soon,
on January 8, 2024 - the first birthday of AIPRM.

If you've not yet considered upgrading, this may be important.

If you decided not to purchase a premium plan, that's OK, too,
we still love you! ❤️

This is a kind reminder about the price increase for new paid
accounts.

AIPRM has introduced many new features in the premium plans that
will make your life easier and more productive,
and we're just getting started.

When you look at what AIPRM Cockpit in the Elite plan will have
in store by watching some of the videos here (
https://simplero.com/d/stgTxK2zW2uuRXu9/c/5288967/2 ), you get an idea.

However, with these new features comes an increase in pricing.

But you still have the opportunity to lock in the early prices
before they're gone.

The best you can do is to buy and prepay an annual plan now, to
lock in the current old price.

This means you can enjoy all the benefits of AIPRM at a lower
cost for as long as you remain a subscriber.

And we would be very thankful for your support.

Here's what you need to know:

* New prices come into effect for new purchases on January 8
2024.

* By subscribing now, you can lock in the current lower prices.

* By subscribing now, you can save yourself quite some money in
the long run.

Here are the current early bird prices for your reference
as listed on our plans page. ( https://simplero.com/d/stgTxK2zW2uuRXu9/c/5288965/3 )

AIPRM Titan: $899/month
AIPRM Team: $149/month

The 2024 Outlook for

Immersive and Eco-

Conscious Design

 
In 2024, the retail and experience design landscape is expected to be driven by sustainability and Gen Z's preferences. Independent retailers will pioneer eco-friendly design aesthetics, with larger brands following suit. Gen Z, seeking an escape from the digital world, will gravitate towards brick-and-mortar stores offering curated product selections and exceptional service. Retail spaces will also serve as sanctuaries from a hectic reality, with designs that create captivating and immersive environments.

2024's Retail Revolution: A New Era of Sustainable and Experiential Design

The retail and experience design in 2024 will likely see a major shift towards sustainability and catering to Gen Z's tastes. Independent retailers are anticipated to lead the way in implementing sustainable interior designs, setting a trend that major brands will adopt. This approach involves using eco-friendly materials and innovative concepts, like repurposing construction materials and recycled items.

Gen Z, aged 12 to 27, will significantly influence retail trends. Contrary to Millennials, they prefer physical stores as a retreat from their online lives, valuing stores with a well-curated selection and personalized service. Retail spaces will offer hands-on product testing and immersive experiences, exemplified by stores like Glossier. Additionally, retail spaces will become refuges from the fast-paced and often challenging external world, drawing customers into unique, aesthetically rich environments designed to encourage prolonged visits.

Graphic Design: A Strategic Asset in the CIA’s Propaganda Arsenal

The CIA has historically recognized the power of graphic design in shaping public perception and spreading American values. Its strategies have involved utilizing popular culture and avant-garde art to discreetly support U.S. propaganda efforts globally. The agency’s covert operations include funding artistic movements and magazines, such as promoting jazz musicians and abstract expressionist painters, to subtly project an image of freedom and counteract negative perceptions of America during the Cold War.

 Tanishq
– Nick Singh here from DataLemur/Ace the Data Science Interview here to warn you about the mid-twit mental trap and how it’s hurting your tech career.

It’s related to those mid-twit IQ-bell curve memes… you've seen these before, right?
IQ bell curve memes make fun of a commonplace phenomena:

Mid-IQs (mid-twits) complicate things.
Dumb & Smart people keep shit simple.

By the end of this email, you will:
* Realize the tech career advice you’ve internalized is likely for mid-twits
* Understand why influencers are incentivized to overcomplicate things
* Become more confident about advancing in your career (because things are actually simple, and the bar is stupidly low)

First, let’s cover how we got into this mid-twit mess.



** Why Gurus Lead Us Into Mid-Twittery 🤦
------------------------------------------------------------
Overly complicated mid-twit advice abounds not because it's correct or helpful.

It's because thought leaders have perverse incentives to lead us into mid-twittery.

Gurus can’t stand out on social media if they give generic, simple advice.

To compete, they differentiate themselves by complicating things in the hopes of capturing your attention.
Similarly, influencers find it hard to monetize simplistic advice, because consumers don’t pay for advice that’ll fit on a single page.

That’s why authors convolute basic concepts and write fluff in order to sell you a 200-page book.

This phenomenon is most obvious in the health & fitness world, where it’s difficult to monetize the one-liner “eat less, exercise more”.

That’s why every few years you'll see another contrived fad diet:

Simply put, for influencers it pays $ to dispense over-complicated advice to mid-twits.

I know what you're probably thinking at this point...



** Nick you're a guru... and a hypocrite?!
------------------------------------------------------------
As someone with 155k LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-singh-tech/) followers, 25k on Twitter (https://twitter.com/NickSinghTech) , and a best-selling book on Data Science Interviews (https://www.acethedatascienceinterview.com/?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=midtwit-career-advice) , you might think it’s a bit hypocritical for me to call out tech influencers and career gurus since I sorta am one!

But I’d like to think my brand was built on dispensing simple, concrete, and mostly FREE advice like:
* Go build portfolio projects (https://www.nicksingh.com/posts/guide-to-creating-kick-ass-data-science-ml-portfolio-projects?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=midtwit-career-advice)
* Show off projects to hiring managers by sending cold emails (https://www.nicksingh.com/posts/cold-email-tips-to-land-your-dream-job-with-examples?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=midtwit-career-advice)
* Go learn SQL by practicing real SQL interview questions (https://datalemur.com/questions?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=midtwit-career-advice)

https://datalemur.com/sql-interview-questions
Of course, if you think I’m guilty of dispensing overly-complicated advice, reply and let me know – I’m always looking for feedback on ways to make my tips simpler!

Anyways, back to the main point for today: the bar is stupidly low, and honestly you don’t need to follow overly complex advice to get ahead in your tech career.



** The Bar Is Shockingly Low
------------------------------------------------------------
Recently, I spoke at the Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) where I covered How to Ace the Data Job Hunt (https://ace-the-data-science-interview.teachable.com/?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=midtwit-career-advice) for a crowd of 120 people.

During the talk, something shocking happened, which made me realize just how low the bar was for job hunting.
I asked the audience:

“On your resume, how published
is your portfolio project”?

2 people out of 120 had a proper URL to their project (ex. DataLemur.com)

5 people had a link to a repo (ex. github .com/NickSingh/DataLemur)

Surprised by how few people had resumes which linked to their project, I asked the 120 people a more basic question:

“Forget links. Who has a non-school,
individually done portfolio project
on your resume?”

Only 10ish more hands went up!

Here I was, droning on and on about how to make a good portfolio project even more amazing by buying a domain name for it (ex. “BobReccomendsMovies.com”).

Yet, 85% of the room didn't even have a single individually & independently finished project to their name!

This experience made me feel so dumb for giving advanced advice when most of the audience hadn’t done the portfolio project basics!



** Low Bar: Facebook Referrals
------------------------------------------------------------
Another story of how low the bar is comes from 2018 when I judged a hackathon at the University of Virginia (my alma mater) on behalf of my employer, Facebook.
Over the course of the weekend, I gave 12 people my official @facebook.com email address since they asked for a referral.

ZERO of them sent me an email asking for a referral within the next year!

I’m not even sure why I bother teaching people about 6 cold email rules to never break (https://ace-the-data-science-interview.teachable.com/courses/ace-the-data-job-hunt/lectures/41010979?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=midtwit-career-advice) when the majority of people won’t even follow-up with someone they met IRL.

Instead of recounting 894 more stories of how doing the basic stuff can get you ahead in your career, I’ll leave you with an apt quote:

“Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.” – Confucius

मोदी ने सर्वनाश कर दिया… देश के माहौल का… यह बात तो 100% सही है।

This is Mark Surman. I'm the President of the Mozilla Foundation, and I want to
thank you for being a part of our Mozilla community. We're so grateful for your
support.										

In just a moment, I'm going to ask you to make a donation to Mozilla. But first,
please let me explain why making that donation today is so important for our
work to reclaim the internet.										

Today is December 31 – it's not just the final day of the year, but alsothe final day to reach our goal of raising $3,300,000 USD from the Mozilla
community. As of this morning, we're very close to getting there... but are still short
about $216,463 USD.										

Reaching this goal is not just about the money we raise. It's about the message that each donation sends to the world.										

When you donate to Mozilla, you are telling irresponsible tech companies that
your privacy isn't something they can share or sell.										

When you donate to Mozilla, you are telling governments around the world that
you will not let them force browsers like Firefox to censor the web.										

When you donate to Mozilla, you are telling activists, builders, and
technologists working on community-focused AI and data tools that their projects
deserve support.										

When you donate to Mozilla, you are saying that it's time to put people back in
control of what happens online – and that it's time to reclaim the internet.                                        																				

So that is why reaching our goal of raising $3,300,000 USD from our Mozilla
community by tonight's deadline is so important. And that is why I'm going to
ask you to make a donation to Mozilla right now.										

Please donate $10 to Mozilla before tonight's deadline. Your gift will help reach our goal and send a message that it's time to reclaim the internet. https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/jbArQEx3A8Cr/b2NmazhkSjlwV3VZeUVzVkY5UzJpOGx2NnFWMUppMUlRVUZIYWFMeDBwL1VHNDJTLzVVS2RVNVkvVHZIZDYvRENYajRueXREVjFpdFZNTHkxd2FEak5oWEtpc3ovYmpwVEVaYjhYdnhQdEk9S0/ 																				Donate now → https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/mWAeBPD4-Zhm/b2NmazhkSjlwV3VZeUVzVkY5UzJpOGx2NnFWMUppMUlRVUZIYWFMeDBwL1VHNDJTLzVVS2RVNVkvVHZIZDYvRENYajRueXREVjFpdFZNTHkxd2FEak5oWEtpc3ovYmpwVEVaYjhYdnhQdEk9S0/ 										   									  

Donations from people like you in our Mozilla community are essential. While
they're not the only source of funding for our non-profit work, donations made
in response to emails like this go directly to support our advocacy, research,
and grantmaking programs.										

So thank you, for being a part of this movement. It is because of your support
that we are able to bring together the people, ideas, and organisations that
will reclaim the internet. I can't wait to see what we do together in 2024.										

Happy New Year,										

Mark Surman

I hope you enjoy your winter holidays, like we do.

Here's a quick reminder about prices for new purchases of AIPRM
premium plans going up on Jan 8.

Lock in the old price before January 8!

You get the best deal, when you buy for a year.

Get AIPRM Elite to view the Prompt Source with 1-Click.

Clone them for your Own Prompts. More lists, private prompts, and
custom writing styles. A second license for your partner.

And soon the AIPRM Elite plan includes: AIPRM Cockpit!

Price for this goes from $79 to $99 on January 8 for new
purchases.

Don't miss it.

The image that says it all.

My recommendation Tanishq:

If you want to go for an AIPRM Premium plan,
then do so soon

to lock in old prices for a year with an annual plan.

SECURE THE OLD PRICE HERE
(but before Jan 8) ( https://simplero.com/d/vrKSre9_hEmmwXFS/c/5280895/0 )

Have a great day,

~Christoph

Founder & CEO
AIPRM

Tanishq

Thanks so much for your interest in AIPRM. We hope you like it!

If you've already considered upgrading to a paid plan,
then this mail is for you.

AIPRM's prices are going up soon,
on January 8, 2024 - the first birthday of AIPRM.

If you've not yet considered upgrading, this may be important.

If you decided not to purchase a premium plan, that's OK, too,
we still love you! ❤️

This is a kind reminder about the price increase for new paid
accounts.

AIPRM has introduced many new features in the premium plans that
will make your life easier and more productive,
and we're just getting started.

When you look at what AIPRM Cockpit in the Elite plan will have
in store by watching some of the videos here (
https://simplero.com/d/vrKSre9_hEmmwXFS/c/5280897/2 ), you get an idea.

However, with these new features comes an increase in pricing.

But you still have the opportunity to lock in the early prices
before they're gone.

The best you can do is to buy and prepay an annual plan now, to
lock in the current old price.

This means you can enjoy all the benefits of AIPRM at a lower
cost for as long as you remain a subscriber.

And we would be very thankful for your support.

Here's what you need to know:

* New prices come into effect for new purchases on January 8
2024.

* By subscribing now, you can lock in the current lower prices.

* By subscribing now, you can save yourself quite some money in
the long run.

Here are the current early bird prices for your reference
as listed on our plans page. ( https://simplero.com/d/vrKSre9_hEmmwXFS/c/5280895/3 )

AIPRM Titan: $899/month
AIPRM Team: $149/month
AIPRM Elite: $79/month
AIPRM Pro: $29/month
AIPRM Plus: $9/month

You can purchase at these prices here after login. (
https://simplero.com/d/vrKSre9_hEmmwXFS/c/5280895/4 )

Don't wait too long Tanishq
to take advantage of this opportunity.

You can subscribe now and secure your spot before the prices go
up.

Here's a heads-up on the new prices that will be coming into
effect for new purchases from January 8.

AIPRM Titan: $999/month
AIPRM Team: $199/month
AIPRM Elite: $99/month
AIPRM Pro: $33/month
AIPRM Plus: $10/month

If you have any questions or concerns,
please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help.

Thanks & best regards,

The team of AIPRM

P.S. By subscribing now, you can lock in the early bird prices
for as many subscriptions as you wish.

P.P.S all prices are still subject to price indexation per our
terms and so the best deal for you now would be an annual plan.

In this Graph Databases for Beginners blog series, we’ll take you through the basics of graph technology. We introduce you to graph databases with basic definitions and why those distinctions matter. The following segments touch on topics like Graph Data Modelling, Graph Theory, Graph Algorithms, Cypher Query Language, Native vs Non-Native Graph Databases and more.

In this article, Tomaz Bratanic discusses the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) and explores two approaches to enhance their performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation. Fine-tuning involves supervised training with question-answer pairs to optimise the LLM’s performance. At the same time, retrieval-augmented generation uses external information sources to produce answers, offering advantages like source-citing and reduced hallucinations.

words rather than matching keywords. Sudhir Hasbe explains how you can get started with Vector Search on Neo4j.

Here's a quick reminder about prices for new purchases of AIPRM premium plans going up on Jan 8. Lock in the old price before January 8","Hi Tanishq

I hope you enjoy your winter holidays, like we do.

Here's a quick reminder about prices for new purchases of AIPRM
premium plans going up on Jan 8.

Lock in the old price before January 8!

You get the best deal, when you buy for a year.

Get AIPRM Elite to view the Prompt Source with 1-Click.

Clone them for your Own Prompts. More lists, private prompts, and
custom writing styles. A second license for your partner.

And soon the AIPRM Elite plan includes: AIPRM Cockpit!

Price for this goes from $79 to $99 on January 8 for new
purchases.

Don't miss it.

The image that says it all.

My recommendation Tanishq:

If you want to go for an AIPRM Premium plan,
then do so soon

to lock in old prices for a year with an annual plan.

SECURE THE OLD PRICE HERE
(but before Jan 8) ( https://simplero.com/d/Eevvz0WaZgDIoR0p/c/5276368/0 )

Have a great day,

~Christoph

Founder & CEO
AIPRM

Tanishq

Thanks so much for your interest in AIPRM. We hope you like it!

If you've already considered upgrading to a paid plan,
then this mail is for you.

AIPRM's prices are going up soon,
on January 8, 2024 - the first birthday of AIPRM.

If you've not yet considered upgrading, this may be important.

If you decided not to purchase a premium plan, that's OK, too,
we still love you! ❤️

This is a kind reminder about the price increase for new paid
accounts.

AIPRM has introduced many new features in the premium plans that
will make your life easier and more productive,
and we're just getting started.

When you look at what AIPRM Cockpit in the Elite plan will have
in store by watching some of the videos here (
https://simplero.com/d/Eevvz0WaZgDIoR0p/c/5276371/2 ), you get an idea.

However, with these new features comes an increase in pricing.

But you still have the opportunity to lock in the early prices
before they're gone.

The best you can do is to buy and prepay an annual plan now, to
lock in the current old price.

This means you can enjoy all the benefits of AIPRM at a lower
cost for as long as you remain a subscriber.

And we would be very thankful for your support.

Here's what you need to know:

* New prices come into effect for new purchases on January 8
2024.

* By subscribing now, you can lock in the current lower prices.

* By subscribing now, you can save yourself quite some money in
the long run.

Here are the current early bird prices for your reference
as listed on our plans page. ( https://simplero.com/d/Eevvz0WaZgDIoR0p/c/5276368/3 )

AIPRM Titan: $899/month
AIPRM Team: $149/month
AIPRM Elite: $79/month
AIPRM Pro: $29/month
AIPRM Plus: $9/month

You can purchase at these prices here after login. (
https://simplero.com/d/Eevvz0WaZgDIoR0p/c/5276368/4 )

Don't wait too long Tanishq
to take advantage of this opportunity.

You can subscribe now and secure your spot before the prices go
up.

Here's a heads-up on the new prices that will be coming into
effect for new purchases from January 8.

AIPRM Titan: $999/month
AIPRM Team: $199/month
AIPRM Elite: $99/month
AIPRM Pro: $33/month
AIPRM Plus: $10/month

If you have any questions or concerns,
please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help.

Thanks & best regards,

The team of AIPRM

P.S. By subscribing now, you can lock in the early bird prices
for as many subscriptions as you wish.

P.P.S all prices are still subject to price indexation per our
terms and so the best deal for you now would be an annual plan.

Imagine a world where privacy is the default, where AI is trustworthy and
enriches our lives for the better, and where the internet is open and accessible
– a world where the internet belongs to the people.									

This world is within reach. Together, we can reclaim the internet. And
grassroots donations play a pivotal role in this work.									

At the start of this year we set an ambitious goal of raising
.Let me be honest with you: just a month ago, reaching that goal seemed
impossible.									

But since then, more than 15,000 people have donated to Mozilla from all around
the world. And as of this morning, Mozilla supporters have contributed $2,785,180 USD towards our $3,300,000 USD goal.									

We're very close to our goal for the year, and I believe it's very important for
us to try and reach it – even if we fall short.									

I’m writing to ask if you will donate to help reach our final goal before the
end of the year.									

Please donate $10 USD to Mozilla before the year ends on December 31. Your donation will help reach our goal and provide important funding for our movement to reclaim the internet. https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/7P~pJ3_Dm7M~/c0FqRGhPMk5GL0R0eWVza0hGRmthcmJXbVgwR0JjSExlaThQbGhjTGtVMjM0M0VMZjlUajJmWjlsYm1iNnA3ZENuZ3NYZjU3SkVaRFROT1dOemNOTkRkQTUzcU5BZ1ZQQ21Lc1ZBUC84a0k9S0/ 									Donate now → https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/pKA6Q9DpNbBy/c0FqRGhPMk5GL0R0eWVza0hGRmthcmJXbVgwR0JjSExlaThQbGhjTGtVMjM0M0VMZjlUajJmWjlsYm1iNnA3ZENuZ3NYZjU3SkVaRFROT1dOemNOTkRkQTUzcU5BZ1ZQQ21Lc1ZBUC84a0k9S0/ 									 									

Here's why this goal is so important: grassroots donations like these directly
fund our advocacy, research, and movement-building efforts to reclaim the
internet. Each donation helps secure better privacy standards, hold
irresponsible tech companies accountable, and build more trustworthy AI.									

But perhaps most importantly, every donation to Mozilla is an investment in our movement – the more people donate, and the more money we raise, the stronger our chances
are at succeeding in our work to reclaim the internet from big tech.									

If we reach our goal by December 31, we'll be able to do things like:									Deepen our campaigning efforts on privacy and AI so that we can do even more to hold big tech companies accountable for irresponsible behaviour and policies;										Direct more funding for technology projects to take on the effects of climate change, like two we supported this year that use AI and data to forecast air quality in Paraguay and seven cities across Africa; and										Expand our efforts to make voice recognition systems more accessible, like Mozilla Common Voice, our free voice recognition dataset available in 114 languages; and support for groups like Te Hiku Media, which works on data sovereignty licences so that voice recognition databases of indigenous languages aren't exploited for corporate profit.									 									

This year, we received 1,953 funding applications from activists, builders,
technologists, and organisations looking for financial support for their
projects. The proposals included AI tools for farmers in Uganda, online
resources for LGBTQ+ youth in South Africa, and so much more. While we funded
130+ projects, that meant we had to say no to 93% of applicants.									

There's so much at stake for the future of the internet, and there's so much
more that we can do to make sure the internet is in the hands of people, not
irresponsible tech companies.									

That’s why I’m asking you today, as a member of the Mozilla community. Can you make an end-of-year donation to Mozilla and help reach our goal of
raising $3,300,000 by December 31?									

Donate $10 USD to Mozilla today so that we can reach our goal and continue to work together to reclaim the internet from irresponsible tech companies in 2024 and beyond. https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/2d~8QdDx9vMK/c0FqRGhPMk5GL0R0eWVza0hGRmthcmJXbVgwR0JjSExlaThQbGhjTGtVMjM0M0VMZjlUajJmWjlsYm1iNnA3ZENuZ3NYZjU3SkVaRFROT1dOemNOTkRkQTUzcU5BZ1ZQQ21Lc1ZBUC84a0k9S0/ 																		Donate now → https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/9P~VJVAvP3Mw/c0FqRGhPMk5GL0R0eWVza0hGRmthcmJXbVgwR0JjSExlaThQbGhjTGtVMjM0M0VMZjlUajJmWjlsYm1iNnA3ZENuZ3NYZjU3SkVaRFROT1dOemNOTkRkQTUzcU5BZ1ZQQ21Lc1ZBUC84a0k9S0/

Hey there!
 
We launched Typedream Products [https://typedream.com/products] earlier this year and so far, we’ve enabled 1,100+ entrepreneurs
make their first dollar online.
 
However, we haven’t been able to serve:
 * Entrepreneurs in India, the Philippines, and many other countries where Stripe is not available

 * Entrepreneurs who want to offer special promotions

 * Entrepreneurs who want to cross-sell/upsell their customers

 
And because of that, we've released more features to help you sell your digital products 👇
 


PayPal as payment option 💰

Now you sell digital products and use Paypal to accept payments!
For those who live in the countries where Stripe is not available to use, you can now easily receive payments via PayPal.
 


Discount code field 🏷️

You can now add a discount code field to offer discounts to your customers! They can simply enter the discount code you gave them
in the payment form.
 


Email marketing feature 💌

With this feature, you can send out email campaigns to promote your products, cross-sell/upsell, or offer discounts to your
customers! Your email audience can be your digital products customers (via Typedream Products) or you can also upload your own
mailing list.
 
Try it out & let us know! Hit us up by clicking Help & Resources on the left menu bar of the editor and click Get Support. Our
team will get back to you as soon as possible! 😉

Typedream Team 💜

For all of December 2023, Christophe Willemsen shares one Neo4j 5 tip daily for 24 days. In this summary, you can find his tips and tricks ranging from Working with Indexes, Cypher Clauses, Change Data Capture, Composite Databases or Vector Indexes.
Multimodal RAG pipeline with LlamaIndex and Neo4j <https://message.neo4j.com/NzEwLVJSQy0zMzUAAAGQM7JFPuY6uOZ5u9yjJOWDl-u7s7RkqhylLq9nbeqNKhW4dBGUoumMQUGLwSb0m13Pm7wFJ4c=>

The field of AI and large language models is evolving rapidly. Today, most of us can’t imagine working without offloading at least some minor tasks to LLMs. Tomaz Bratanic looks at the latest development around GPT-4-Vision, enabling image comprehension. He shows you how to retrieve and combine information from text and images to generate an accurate response with multimodal LLMs.
RAG with a Neo4j Knowledge Graph: How it Works and How to Set It Up <https://message.neo4j.com/NzEwLVJSQy0zMzUAAAGQM7JFPizCMTtFKlftYdl92e9qn2l_-DRW3L5unwUB92xVb5TEiAWlWVAJRcyLp3pEpLH4wm4=>

In this video, Philipp Brunenberg explains how RAG (retrieval augmented generation) with a Neo4j Knowledge Graph works and how we can set it up on your laptop. He also briefly introduces how we can customise the code from the Gen-AI Stack.
Vector Indexing plus Knowledge Graphs with Neo4j <https://message.neo4j.com/NzEwLVJSQy0zMzUAAAGQM7JFP4Q4kt8YfLqGXtH2cPAiR6ohWmMwP1x3x1nPA5fZcKZFZKcIiJDr7WfcVZWhZkpLCLk=>

Vector indexing is thought of as a typical implementation for Generative AI. While this is true at a very rudimentary level, Jeff Tallman discusses using vector indexes in Neo4j to complement graph analytics (non-AI) when data quality is poor, resulting in loose text search-based retrievals.

 Tanishq
– recently I sent you a depressing email about how AI is coming for your tech job.

Today, I want to be more ✨positive✨, and focus on how to AI-proof your career, so that you can surf this AI wave, rather than be crushed by it.
Even though I’ve been in the data space for a while (https://amzn.to/3kF79Fx) , I’m not an AI expert, so I:
* hit up an entrepreneur friend for suggestions (who raised ~$12M for his generative AI startup)
* sent a cold email (https://www.nicksingh.com/posts/cold-email-tips-to-land-your-dream-job-with-examples?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ai-proof-career) to an OpenAI researcher & got his off-the-record advice 🤫
* solicited tips from three of my LinkedIn Data Science influencer friends (you probably follow them)

Their advice is generally relevant to anyone in tech – it doesn’t matter if you're a beginner Data Analyst, intermediate Programmer, or an experienced ML Engineer – their insights are broadly applicable 👇



** Lean Into AI Harder
------------------------------------------------------------
While there was no clear consensus of how much AI-related job loss there will be, the AI gurus all said something along the lines of:

“AI won’t take your job, someone using AI will”

""Current AI tools aren't perfect, but they're more powerful than you think""

“Most techies aren’t using AI tools frequently enough yet”

Andrej Karpathy, former Head of Self-Driving at Tesla, noticed similarly slow adoption for GitHub’s code-writing Copilot tool:

While adopting a new tool into your workflow is uncomfortable sooner or later, they’ll be the de facto way we work, so might as well get used to it!

And yes, I’m practicing what I preach👇



**
Become Product-Oriented
------------------------------------------------------------
The AI experts thought that technical skills like writing SQL queries (https://datalemur.com/sql-interview-questions?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ai-proof-career)  will become commoditized over the next decade.

However, they didn’t feel the same way when it came to the art of knowing what to build, and wrangling teams of humans to execute on that product vision.

Legendary programmer John Carmack – the former CTO of Oculus VR – also thinks these product management skills are here to stay:



**
We're Still Early
------------------------------------------------------------
From working with my career coaching clients (https://ace-the-data-science-interview.teachable.com/?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ai-proof-career) , I’ve encountered:
* Non-technical people who think it’s too late to learn coding
* Coders & Data Analysts who think it’s too late to specialize in ML
* ML Engineers who think it’s too late to build generative AI products because OpenAI / Google / StableDiffusion are too far ahead

I don’t blame them for feeling this way, given how fast AI is evolving.

But think of it this way: if you believe that AI is going to transform the world this century, how does it matter if you got deep into AI in 2013, or in 2023?

You’ll likely be working on AI or AI-adjacent tech in 2053 so who cares if you're behind by a few years, on a multi-decade timeline.
To help you get started with your path into AI, I’ve curated a free resource list below.

I bucketed the materials into 3 difficulty levels based on how much AI background knowledge you have.

Today December 20 is the last day for you to

get another discount for the AIPRM for subscription lifetime.

You can use code WINTERLEET17 for

17% off on the monthly AIPRM Elite plan, from the old price.

If you go for a year, it comes down to 31% off even.

Then the regular old price of $79 will be around, until Jan 8.

Here is the image that says it all.

My recommendation Tanishq:

If you want to go for an AIPRM Premium plan,
then do so soon

to lock in old prices for a year with an annual plan.

SECURE THE OLD PRICE HERE
(but before Jan 8) ( https://simplero.com/d/JxxCQP7oE7uGbZJq/c/5261291/1 )

Thanks so much for your interest in AIPRM. We hope you like it!

If you've already considered upgrading to a paid plan,
then this mail is for you.

AIPRM's prices are going up soon,
on January 8, 2024 - the first birthday of AIPRM.

If you've not yet considered upgrading, this may be important.

If you decided not to purchase a premium plan, that's OK, too,
we still love you! ❤️

This is a kind reminder about the price increase for new paid
accounts.

AIPRM has introduced many new features in the premium plans that
will make your life easier and more productive,
and we're just getting started.

When you look at what AIPRM Cockpit in the Elite plan will have
in store by watching some of the videos here (
https://simplero.com/d/JxxCQP7oE7uGbZJq/c/5261281/3 ), you get an idea.

However, with these new features comes an increase in pricing.

But you still have the opportunity to lock in the early prices
before they're gone.

The best you can do is to buy and prepay an annual plan now, to
lock in the current old price.

This means you can enjoy all the benefits of AIPRM at a lower
cost for as long as you remain a subscriber.

And we would be very thankful for your support.

Here's what you need to know:

* New prices come into effect for new purchases on January 8
2024.

* By subscribing now, you can lock in the current lower prices.

* By subscribing now, you can save yourself quite some money in
the long run.

Here are the current early bird prices for your reference
as listed on our plans page. ( https://simplero.com/d/JxxCQP7oE7uGbZJq/c/5261291/4 )

AIPRM Titan: $899/month
AIPRM Team: $149/month
AIPRM Elite: $79/month
AIPRM Pro: $29/month
AIPRM Plus: $9/month

You can purchase at these prices here after login. (
https://simplero.com/d/JxxCQP7oE7uGbZJq/c/5261291/5 )

Don't wait too long Tanishq
to take advantage of this opportunity.

You can subscribe now and secure your spot before the prices go
up.

Here's a heads-up on the new prices that will be coming into
effect for new purchases from January 8.

AIPRM Titan: $999/month
AIPRM Team: $199/month
AIPRM Elite: $99/month
AIPRM Pro: $33/month
AIPRM Plus: $10/month

If you have any questions or concerns,
please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help.

Thanks & best regards,

The team of AIPRM

P.S. By subscribing now, you can lock in the early bird prices
for as many subscriptions as you wish.

P.P.S all prices are still subject to price indexation per our
terms and so the best deal for you now would be an annual plan.

A Journey into Design Leadership with Jamie Wolfond

to lock in old prices for a year with an annual plan.

If you've already considered upgrading to a paid plan,
then this mail is for you.

AIPRM's prices are going up soon,
on January 8, 2024 - the first birthday of AIPRM.

If you've not yet considered upgrading, this may be important.

If you decided not to purchase a premium plan, that's OK, too,
we still love you! ❤️

This is a kind reminder about the price increase for new paid
accounts.

AIPRM has introduced many new features in the premium plans that
will make your life easier and more productive,
and we're just getting started.

When you look at what AIPRM Cockpit in the Elite plan will have
in store by watching some of the videos here (
https://simplero.com/d/K-5dUwTPvZjGw8cj/c/5257742/2 ), you get an idea.

However, with these new features comes an increase in pricing.

But you still have the opportunity to lock in the early prices
before they're gone.

The best you can do is to buy and prepay an annual plan now, to
lock in the current old price.

This means you can enjoy all the benefits of AIPRM at a lower
cost for as long as you remain a subscriber.

And we would be very thankful for your support.

Here's what you need to know:

* New prices come into effect for new purchases on January 8
2024.

* By subscribing now, you can lock in the current lower prices.

* By subscribing now, you can save yourself quite some money in
the long run.

Here are the current early bird prices for your reference
as listed on our plans page. ( https://simplero.com/d/K-5dUwTPvZjGw8cj/c/5257759/3 )

AIPRM Titan: $899/month
AIPRM Team: $149/month
AIPRM Elite: $79/month
AIPRM Pro: $29/month
AIPRM Plus: $9/month

You can purchase at these prices here after login. (
https://simplero.com/d/K-5dUwTPvZjGw8cj/c/5257758/4 )

Don't wait too long Tanishq
to take advantage of this opportunity.

You can subscribe now and secure your spot before the prices go
up.

Here's a heads-up on the new prices that will be coming into
effect for new purchases from January 8.

AIPRM Titan: $999/month
AIPRM Team: $199/month
AIPRM Elite: $99/month
AIPRM Pro: $33/month
AIPRM Plus: $10/month

If you have any questions or concerns,
please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help.

Thanks & best regards,

The team of AIPRM

P.S. By subscribing now, you can lock in the early bird prices
for as many subscriptions as you wish.

P.P.S all prices are still subject to price indexation per our
terms and so the best deal for you now would be an annual plan.

If you've already considered upgrading to a paid plan,
then this mail is for you.

AIPRM's prices are going up soon,
on January 8, 2024 - the first birthday of AIPRM.

If you've not yet considered upgrading, this may be important.

If you decided not to purchase a premium plan, that's OK, too,
we still love you! ❤️

This is a kind reminder about the price increase for new paid
accounts.

AIPRM has introduced many new features in the premium plans that
will make your life easier and more productive,
and we're just getting started.

When you look at what AIPRM Cockpit in the Elite plan will have
in store by watching some of the videos here (
https://simplero.com/d/TTS0uKgVZ-uBh0IV/c/5256122/0 ), you get an idea.

However, with these new features comes an increase in pricing.

But you still have the opportunity to lock in the early prices
before they're gone.

The best you can do is to buy and prepay an annual plan now, to
lock in the current old price.

This means you can enjoy all the benefits of AIPRM at a lower
cost for as long as you remain a subscriber.

And we would be very thankful for your support.

Here's what you need to know:

* New prices come into effect for new purchases on January 8
2024.
* By subscribing now, you can lock in the current lower prices.
* By subscribing now, you can save yourself quite some money in
the long run.

Here are the current early bird prices for your reference
as listed on our plans page. ( https://simplero.com/d/TTS0uKgVZ-uBh0IV/c/5256123/1 )

AIPRM Titan: $899/month
AIPRM Team: $149/month
AIPRM Elite: $79/month
AIPRM Pro: $29/month
AIPRM Plus: $9/month

You can purchase at these prices here after login. (
https://simplero.com/d/TTS0uKgVZ-uBh0IV/c/5256124/2 )

Don't wait too long Tanishq
to take advantage of this opportunity.

You can subscribe now and secure your spot before the prices go
up.

Here's a heads-up on the new prices that will be coming into
effect for new purchases from January 8.

AIPRM Titan: $999/month
AIPRM Team: $199/month
AIPRM Elite: $99/month
AIPRM Pro: $33/month
AIPRM Plus: $10/month

If you have any questions or concerns,
please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help.

Thanks & best regards,

The team of AIPRM

P.S. By subscribing now, you can lock in the early bird prices
for as many subscriptions as you wish.

P.P.S all prices are still subject to price indexation per our
terms and so the best deal for you now would be an annual plan.

 Tanishq
–
I’m sorry to say, but AI is likely coming for your job.

Before you write me off as some clickbait AI doomer, I want to explain to you why 95% of the tech community (yes, even Data Science & ML folks!) are not correctly thinking about how AI will negatively impact our future earnings potential.

First up, we tend to read stories like the one below, but then think our own job is safe because we're ✨special✨.
You can accuse me of fear-mongering, but I'm genuinely trying to warn you about what's coming down the pipeline:

I'm here to warn you that you might be making non-optimal career decisions today, because you're underestimating the risk AI poses for 2 big reasons:

• Sapien Centrism
• Linear Brains



** The Universe Revolves Around You
------------------------------------------------------------
We Homo Sapiens have a long track-record of sapien centrism, where we elevate our uniqueness and role in the universe

It was only 450 years ago that the Western world thought Earth was the center of the universe, and that the Sun ☀️ and stars revolved around us.
In the 1960s, the consensus view was that computers couldn't ever beat a top chess player, because our brains were just so special.

But recent improvements in AI have shown us this that playing games like Chess and Go, doing creative tasks like art and poetry, and problem solving in math and coding aren't skills only for humans.

Just look at some of GPT's recent test scores to see what I mean:

Yet most people remain in denial, clinging to some hope that humanity has some magic pixie dust that makes us uniquely intelligent and creative.

Most people aren't willing to acknowledge just how creative GPT-4 already is:

Faced with the insane accomplishments of LLMs, there’s still enough techies who'll trivialize GPT's accomplishments and say it's just a ""stochastic parrot"" using statistics to repeat and copy things from the internet.

These same techies fail to remember that much of what we humans do, like Software Engineering, already relies on copy-pasting code from StackOverflow:
Then there's another group of people who see shortcomings in today’s GPT & LLM models, and gleefully conclude:

“SEE! We humans are special
because computers can’t do X”.

I think this nit-picky group suffers from a phenomenon I call linear brains.



** Linear Brains Livin' In A Exponential World
------------------------------------------------------------
Homo Sapiens evolved during a 550,000 year period when things were mostly stagnant, relative to today’s changing world.

I mean look at just how long it us to invent farming, stone tools, and writing:

Our brains evolved during a comparatively ""linear"" period of time, where technological progress was infrequent, slow, and mostly ""linear"".

As such, we’re terrible at reasoning about exponential processes.

But we need to realize that the internet is only 40 years old (1983), and we’re in the very early openings for tech/computing.

Looking at the progress we’ve had just in the past few years when it comes to AI, and realize we’re growing at an exponential rate.

But even with an acknowledgment of the exponential rate-of-progress, thanks to our linear brains, we humans STILL underpredict the effects of AI.

That’s why when people nit-pick LLM performance, and say:
“computers can’t do X”

I like to say:
“computers can’t do X YET”.

I'm never trying to argue that today's GPT models are perfect, or that tomorrow you'll be fired because of chatGPT.

I'm concerned that given how powerful these GPT models are today, and how quickly they're improving, using our linear brains to reason about the future effects of AI causes us to grossly underestimate this technology.



** So Nick, what we do?
------------------------------------------------------------
Because of my book Ace the Data Science Interview (https://amzn.to/3kF79Fx) , data science job hunting video course (https://ace-the-data-science-interview.teachable.com/?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=your-career-is-at-risk) , and frequent career advice posts on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-singh-tech/) , people naturally come to me with questions like:

“How do I adapt my career/respond
to the threat of AI-related job loss??”

I’m sorry, but I don’t have any solid answers yet.

I wish I could list off 37 reasons why the AI-hype is overblown and your 10-year career plan is safe, but at this moment, in good faith, I can't articulate that.

Venture Capitalist Paul Graham (founder of YCombinator) is similarly confused:

John Carmack, legendary programmer and former CTO of Oculus VR, was asked a similar question by a Computer Science student, and had this to say:

In a few weeks, I hope to round up some more actionable ideas to AI-proof our careers. In the meantime, I have a question for you:

What actions do you plan to take,
to prevent AI from taking your job?

Kubernetes deployments can become quite complicated regarding scale, the number of resources and understanding how different components interact. In this article, Mohit Gupta introduces IceKube, an open-source tool that enumerates a cluster and generates a graph database of resource configurations and the relationships between different resources. IceKube can then analyse these relationships and identify potential attacks.

Our Podcast reviews what we at Neo4j (and a lot of the tech industry, in general) have been spending much of our time thinking about and building: Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs. Tomaž Bratanič and Oskar Hane are joining the team to dive deeper into these topics for this recap episode.
Try Neo4j’s Next-Gen Graph-Native Store Format <https://message.neo4j.com/NzEwLVJSQy0zMzUAAAGQD6aENGXYJPMZs_I_4fscIeRJEdSoM7138oC36KDFyApNlgidx_hXrGzJlKIUUS1ShFKu-Co=>

The latest version of Neo4j 5 Enterprise Edition (v.5.14) includes the beta release of our highly anticipated new storage engine that introduces Block format, a generational leap in graph-native storage. Compared to the existing Record format, the Block format performs roughly 40% better when the whole graph is in memory. That lead increases to 70% when only a third of the graph can fit in memory. David Pond shows you how to try it on your local instance today.

Hey Tanish,

As the clock ticks, opportunities thin out. I'm reaching out with a

Now, if you're contemplating the ""why"" behind the rapid disappearance of
these licenses, let's get into the nuts and bolts. 

Presenting to you, the brain behind BiteSyzed: its groundbreaking AI.

Hey there!
 
We're building a GPT builder that enables you to create a custom GPT and host it on your own custom domain!
 

Get early access → [https://typedream.com/gpt]

 
Just one month ago, OpenAI introduced GPT Builder, allowing the creation of specialized GPTs for tasks like solving math homework,
getting startup feedback, or improving dating profiles.

However, these custom GPTs come with random links and require your users a ChatGPT Plus subscription. Our new builder solves these
issues by offering custom domains and allowing anyone (including those without a ChatGPT Plus subscription) to use your custom
GPT.
 
If you've built a custom GPT before, reply to this email. We'd love to chat more with you!
 
Got questions? Hit us up by clicking Help & Resources on the left menu bar of the editor and click Get Support. Our team will get
back to you as soon as possible! 😉
 
Thank you,
Typedream Team 💜

**Your privacy is very Important to us.** 

Hey Tanish,

I've got some blazing news that you might want to sit down for. 

Exclusive BiteSyzed lifetime licenses are flying off the virtual
shelves! 

As it stands, we've already parted with 29 of our 50 reserved copies.
Just like that. Poof! 

And this is the last email you'll receive about this limited-time offer,
specifically designed for our notification list.

Click here for instant access!

Here's the thing: I'm genuinely concerned. Once we open the floodgates
to our broader list, I have a strong hunch these remaining licenses will
vanish, snap, in the blink of an eye.

**Your Window is Narrowing!**

If growing your audience like wildfire with effortless short-form videos
is on your radar (and it should be!), then your best shot, perhaps your
only shot, is to act now. 

This isn't marketing hype, it's math.

**Why act now?**

This is your golden ticket to avoid the recurring $97/month fee. Secure
your spot, and you'll get BiteSyzed for less than the cost of a posh
dinner.

It's a no-brainer for anyone looking to dominate the digital landscape
with content that actually converts.

Once the main list gets wind of this, it'll be a mad scramble - and
there's a real chance you might miss out.

Secure Your Lifetime License Now!

I cannot stress enough how pivotal this tool can be for your online
presence. 

Don't let this slip between your fingers.

We're wishing you nothing but success,

**Cheers,**

**Federico**

**Founder of Supportboar**

**P.S.** Time and licenses wait for no one. Take control of your digital
destiny.

about for a while is finally here!  

ByteSized is now LIVE. It's only available to our subscribers like
you. 

Get instant access now!

Here's the catch: 

We already opened the gates for our Early Bird list and, well, they were
pretty eager. 

We started with 50 exclusive lifetime licenses, but now we're down to
just 29. 

They're going fast, and I'm not exaggerating.

Grab your lifetime license now!

**Why BiteSyzed? **

In today's digital age, short-form videos are your best bet to capture
attention and skyrocket engagement. 

The beauty of BiteSyzed? 

It's your magic wand that turns any video into dozens of crisp,
engaging, and shareable short-form videos. 

The potential for virality? Through the roof.

Here's a quick reminder of why everyone's clamoring for a slice of the
ByteSized pie:

Instantly leverage the power of short-form videos to build a
massive audience.

Turn any lengthy video into dozens of bite-sized, viral gems.

Position yourself as the go-to authority in your niche.

It's an easy decision if you're serious about supercharging your online
presence.

Claim Your BiteSyzed License NOW!

I hate to sound like a broken record, but with only 29 licenses
remaining, the clock is ticking loudly. You've seen the demand. Now,
it's your move.

**Cheers,**

**Federico**

**Founder of Supportboar**

**P.S.** Those who adapt to the short-form video trend will rule the
roost. Make sure you're leading the pack.

Don't Miss Out - Grab Your License!

Hey Tanish,

In my previous email, I delved deep into the revolutionary power of
short-form video content and why... 

It's your golden ticket to building a HOT audience of prospects, leads,
and customers in 2024 and beyond.

**Short-form videos** aren't just another fleeting trend.

Here is the thing... Excitement is in the air!  

We are helping launch tomorrow a new cutting-edge AI tool that turns
long videos into dozens of high-quality, audience-building 1-minute
videos. Its called 

**BiteSyzed.**

We're going live with BiteSyzed tomorrow at 10:00 AM EST. 

Let's delve deep into the revolutionary power of short-form video
content and why... 

It's your golden ticket to building a HOT audience of prospects, leads,
and customers in 2023 and beyond.

**Short-form videos** aren't just another fleeting trend. 

They are THE medium of our age of dwindling attention spans. 

Now, it's true.

TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook are now swarmed with short-form
video creators.

But guess what?

You can still build your own HOT audience of fans, buyers, and clients
with short-form videos.

In fact, the field is still wide open for those who want to leverage
short-from list-building videos for growing a list for their BUSINESS.

**And here's why:**

Most businesses have no clue how to consistently deliver high-quality
content in one minute or less!

Imagine an older professor trying to blend in at a college frat party by
donning a backwards cap and talking ""slang."" 

Cringey, right? 

That's how most businesses come across with their short-form content.
They miss the mark. 

Instead of offering real value in a succinct format, they 

**fragment** their message, turning it into promotional white noise.

The young guns - YouTubers and influencers - have their fingers on
the pulse. 

They've mastered the art of being succinct and engaging. 

But, the truth is, crafting these compact content pieces consistently
can feel like an uphill battle.

**When you boil it down, you've got two options:**

**Script Individual Videos: **

This involves brainstorming and scripting numerous bite-sized videos. 

While it ensures variety, it's time-consuming.

**Trim Down a Long Video: **

Think of it as creating a documentary and then carving out 1-minute
trailers from it. 

**Sounds great in theory, but in reality? **

A logistical nightmare. It's like trying to find needles (those golden
moments) in a haystack.

**But what if there was a third option? **

A method that retains the essence of your content and effortlessly
transforms it into many, high-quality bite-sized videos? 

Introducing... 

**BiteSyzed: **

A new cutting-edge AI tool that turns long videos into dozens of
high-quality, audience-building 1-minute videos. 

Bitesyzed AI doesn't just skim the surface. 

It dives deep into your long-form video. By using sophisticated
algorithms and machine learning, the AI identifies key moments,
emotional peaks, and insightful sections, ensuring that nothing of value
goes unnoticed. 

Whether it's a poignant pause, a burst of laughter, or a profound
revelation, Bitesyzed captures it all.

**And the icing on the cake? **

It customizes these snippets for major platforms like TikTok, Facebook,
and Instagram. 

Never have to deal with resizing hassles!

Actually BiteSyzed packs far too many powerful features to cram into a
single email. But here's the deal:

Tomorrow we are launching a special founder's offer where 50 of our
subscribers will be able to get access to this deal at a nominal one-off
price before we go public with it. When they go public with it, the
lowest plan is going to sell for $97/month.

But that's not all. 

To ensure you're fully equipped, the founder's offer packs of
exclusive training - 

**Short-Form Video Mastery Training (Value $297)**

A comprehensive A-Z training course on building a massive, targeted
audience with short-form videos. 

Covers identifying high-traction platforms, brainstorming magnetic
content ideas, optimizing for algorithm success, distribution tactics,
and more.

We're launching tomorrow :)

**Cheers,**

**Federico**

TOPICS COVERED

Selling Design Systems
We all know design systems and pattern libraries are great, but how do you get your clients, bosses, and teammates on board? Brad will make the business cases for design systems, and discuss tactics and tools for selling design systems to clients and stakeholders.

A Pattern-Based Process
Making modular interfaces requires massive shifts in our design and development process. Brad will discuss why front-end development is an essential part of the design process and demonstrate how tools like lo-fi sketches, style tiles, frontend workshop tools like Storybook and Pattern Lab, and others facilitate collaboration—and result in successful design systems.

Atomic Design Principles
Brad will cover core principles of modular UI interface design and introduce the atomic design methodology that helps connect your design system design/dev work to your actual product design/dev work.

Creating a rock-solid component library
The heart and soul of a successful design system is a component library that lives in code and directly powers an organization's software products. Brad will cover all that goes into creating a UI component library that's reusable, flexible, extensible, and easy to work with.

Anatomy of Effective Reference Website
A style guide reference website is the happy home for all a design system’s ingredients. A robust and well-presented reference site can help a design system truly take root at your organization.

Design System Maintenance
Like a fine wine, a design system should increase in value over time. Brad will discuss tactics and techniques like team structure, versioning, managing changes and additions to the system, communication strategies, and more to ensure your design system provides lasting value to your organization.

Why would you do that to him? It takes amazing hard work and perseverance to have such a reach on YouTube and for a 12 y/o to achieve that makes it much more impressive.

**Your privacy is very Important to us.** 

Hey Tanish,

Whether you're an agency, freelancer, or involved in any online
business in ANY way  - you probably heard that ""money is in the
list."" 

Most people assume it's all about the email lists. And most of the time
- but not always - they are right.

**But here's the rub: **

Today, building that coveted list is harder than ever. There are three
reasons why:

* Ad costs are skyrocketing, making it crazy expensive to build an email
list.

* People's attention spans are shrinking, so fewer folks are engaging
with your emails and making purchases.

* The battle for attention is more intense than ever.

Let's take a look at Facebook.

For years it's been considered the most affordable platform for lead
generation. 

**But today?**

See for yourself:

As you can see, in September 2023, the average cost to generate a lead
on Facebook was $10.42.

That means if you're aiming to build a list of 1,000 prospects, you're
looking at shelling out over $10,000.

And that's if things go 

**your way.**

But even after dropping that 10 grand on 1,000 prospects, there's the
headache of email deliverability.

And you might find yourself paying $500/month-$2,000/month to a
deliverability expert to make sure your emails land in your
subscriber's primary inbox.

So, what's the move? Throw in the towel and skip building your list?
Heck no.

That could be the most counter-productive thing you could do.

Instead, I've got a killer suggestion for you:

Dive into a game-changing strategy that lets you generate a tribe of hot
prospects who know, like and trust you - without breaking the bank.
And OFTEN - without spending a penny at all!

**Ready for it?**

I'm talking about 

**short-form video content!**

Bet you didn't see that coming.

But here's the thing - in 2023, short-form video content is king. In
2024, it's going to be even Bigger.

It's raking in the highest engagement levels and doesn't show signs of
slowing down.

Just look at the giants in the game: TikTok continues its meteoric rise,
captivating millions worldwide.

Instagram Reels is not far behind, with creators and businesses alike
leveraging its power.

And let's not forget YouTube Shorts, which is quickly carving out its
niche, benefiting from the platform's massive existing user base.

Together, these platforms are a testament to the unstoppable force of
short-form video content.

So it's the most effective medium to build a list of followers from
scratch... quickly and easily.

**According to Business2Community.com, a leading voice in the business
and digital marketing space, Short Form video marketing strategies can
yield up to a 30% ROI when executed correctly.  Most businesses have
no clue**

**how to execute it correctly!**

**The cherry on top?**

Most businesses are clueless when it comes to consistently churning out
short-form video content. (This includes your competitors.)

Why?

1-2 minute videos are a brand new format compared to text and long-form
video.

**Historically,** marketers haven't been pressed to cram their entire
story into less than a minute.

This means that 

**if you know what you are doing** you can use short-form videos to...
not only quickly build your list with zero regard for your competitors
- but even steal your competitors' leads and followers.

Over the past year that's been a service my agency has been offering
to our clients. So, you're going to see some groundbreaking - yet
simple - strategies for you can't find anywhere else.

Stay tuned - I'll be back with more soon.

**Cheers,**

**Federico**

**Founder of Supportboar**

**P.S.** One of our partners have crafted an AI-powered tool that lets
you whip up virtually endless short-form videos for all the major
platforms with just a few clicks. It's specifically designed to: 1)
Grow your audience; 2) Effectively sell your products and services using
short-form video content.

Nothing similar is available on the market yet.

Soon I'll be running a founder's deal where you'll be able to grab
it for a small nominal price before we go public with it.

Get in early, and you can snag it at a special founder's price. Curious?

I’m Mitchell Baker, the CEO of Mozilla. As I do every year, I’ve been reflecting
on what’s happened in the world and online – and what it means for Mozilla and
the state of the Internet.									

There’s never just one story or conclusion about what’s happening online around
the world. But I am hearing a consistent theme:it can feel like people are no longer in control of the internet and how it
affects our lives.And many people have reasonably concluded that this is unlikely to change
because irresponsible practices seem to be the norm among tech companies.									

I know this feeling because I’ve experienced it before. It once seemed
inevitable that Microsoft would own the internet forever. They owned the operating systems, the backend server equipment – and an
incredible 97% market share. In order to hold onto their monopoly, Microsoft was
on a public mission to squash any competitors.									

That’s the environment in which we created Firefox and the Mozilla project 25
years ago. Against all odds, our open source browser shook up the status quo. It
allowed us to build our products differently, to inspire others, and build our
own market share. Together, we changed the course of history by building both a vision and a movement towards an internet that is open and accessible to all.									

We are still in this same fight today. And we have the same significant advantage: we do not have to maximise value for
shareholders – we can put people over profit.The Mozilla Foundation is a non-profit organisation, and I'm writing to ask you
to make a donation today.									

Will you make a $10 USD donation to the Mozilla Foundation today and help build our movement to reclaim the internet? Our fight started 25 years ago with Microsoft, and the fight continues to this day. Are you in? https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/wdAgQjkeR2cY/TlcwQnM1NjFNWEw3ZWtQaFREOTk3ZjFtcFhVWnJINFFFZTg0c2FHd0FpWm00YjdiaGhJT3YxREJIZDlnMUVqYmhvNFE2bzBJTmZsNVBjVy9VNzkwZlNyemhMbGZzTkppLzdOQU1STGRNM1U9S0/ 									 																		Donate now → https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/q7AwH93_jySP/TlcwQnM1NjFNWEw3ZWtQaFREOTk3ZjFtcFhVWnJINFFFZTg0c2FHd0FpWm00YjdiaGhJT3YxREJIZDlnMUVqYmhvNFE2bzBJTmZsNVBjVy9VNzkwZlNyemhMbGZzTkppLzdOQU1STGRNM1U9S0/ 									 																		

In the early days of Firefox, the internet was in a rapid moment of change and
we disrupted the marketplace by challenging the status quo and supporting others
to do the same.									

But today, the internet is also in a time of change – and it’s also in a time of
crisis. AI is bringing game changing new capabilities to computing, and frankly, we
don’t even fully understand what these will mean for society.									

Much like in those early days of the internet, the AI space is dominated by a
few, large companies that aren’t being transparent about how they build these
models and what they do. We are living in a time where too often, people are the
product and data is taken for profit. If we don’t act now, I’m concerned that
people will lose control over how the internet affects their lives.									

We don’t need to adopt these irresponsible practices nor do we need to take
these companies’ place in the market.									

Our power comes from the people who decided to look for an alternative. To the
people who decided to reclaim control of our experiences online. To reclaim our
data, our sanity, our communities and our mental health. The Mozilla community’s

WHEN?
Thursday, December 14th 9:00AM-4:00PM PST

WHAT YOU'LL LEARN

TOPICS COVERED

Selling Design Systems
We all know design systems and pattern libraries are great, but how do you get your clients, bosses, and teammates on board? Brad will make the business cases for design systems, and discuss tactics and tools for selling design systems to clients and stakeholders.

A Pattern-Based Process
Making modular interfaces requires massive shifts in our design and development process. Brad will discuss why front-end development is an essential part of the design process and demonstrate how tools like lo-fi sketches, style tiles, frontend workshop tools like Storybook and Pattern Lab, and others facilitate collaboration—and result in successful design systems.

Atomic Design Principles
Brad will cover core principles of modular UI interface design and introduce the atomic design methodology that helps connect your design system design/dev work to your actual product design/dev work.

Creating a rock-solid component library
The heart and soul of a successful design system is a component library that lives in code and directly powers an organization's software products. Brad will cover all that goes into creating a UI component library that's reusable, flexible, extensible, and easy to work with.

Anatomy of Effective Reference Website
A style guide reference website is the happy home for all a design system’s ingredients. A robust and well-presented reference site can help a design system truly take root at your organization.

Design System Maintenance
Like a fine wine, a design system should increase in value over time. Brad will discuss tactics and techniques like team structure, versioning, managing changes and additions to the system, communication strategies, and more to ensure your design system provides lasting value to your organization.

In our books, setting up for success means balancing both ramping up quickly and scaling seamlessly.

And that's what we've been working on since you last heard from us.

Here is what's new:

---------------------------------------------
Quick infra setup: automatic work pool in GCP
---------------------------------------------

Going from your laptop to a fully working GCP project means thinking about infra. Now—think less, but still get your infra. With one Prefect CLI command, you can automatically configure your GCP project and set up your Prefect workspace to use a new Cloud Run push pool immediately: prefect work-pool create

Take your local Python to GCP in a matter of minutes. Read about the new capability here ( https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/RELEASE-NOTES.md?utm_campaign=Cloud+Broadcast+12%2F6&utm_content=Cloud+Broadcast+12%2F6&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=email#automatic-project-configuration-for-cloud-run-push-work-pools ).

-----------------------------------------------
Designing for scale: handling hundreds of tasks
-----------------------------------------------

We've seen flows with hundreds of tasks. If one of them fails, it is absolutely critical for you to see its dependencies. This means design is not just a
sparkling touch—the design effort in Prefect is about building a UI/UX that does not slow you down when handling critical errors.

See it in action 👇

* Need to run a workflow ad-hoc? Use webhooks. Watch a use case about firing a flow with Github webhooks here ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khVS5M3QY54&utm_campaign=Cloud+Broadcast+12%2F6&utm_content=Cloud+Broadcast+12%2F6&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=email ).
Remember, think about scale early to have less restructuring down the road. And if you've got Python projects that are scaling out of control, try Prefect. We're here to help.

Important Licensing Changes to Microsoft India Commercial Business
Microsoft India is announcing Indian rupee pricelist changes to harmonize its prices for commercial software and online services between India and the Asian region, effective February 1, 2024. Microsoft periodically assesses the impact of its local pricing for software products and online services to ensure there is reasonable alignment across regions and this change is an outcome of this assessment.  
 
Starting February 1, 2024, Indian rupee prices for commercial on-premises software will increase by 6%, online services will also increase by 6% to realign close to prevailing USD pricing levels in the Asian region. On Microsoft.com, revised Indian rupee prices for direct sales to India based customers for a select set of online services such as Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365 will be reflected as of February 1, 2024.  For business customers, these changes will not affect existing orders under volume licensing agreements for products that are subject to price protection. However, prices for new product additions under such volume licensing agreements and purchases under new contracts will be as defined by the pricelist at the time of order. Customers across India buying online services in Indian rupee will continue to find Microsoft cloud offerings highly competitive.
 
For indirect sales where Microsoft products are sold through resellers, final prices and currency of sale will continue to be determined by resellers.

Visual Communication as a Force for Social Change: The Impact of Graphic Design
Visual Communication as a

Force for Social Change:

The Impact of Graphic

Design

 
Graphic design is vital in social change, with icons like the peace sign symbolizing movements. Fay Qiu, a New York-based designer, uses her art to address issues affecting minorities, the LGBTQ community, and Asian Americans. Her work includes advocating against Asian hate and promoting queer joy, employing powerful visual elements. Her approach transcends traditional aesthetics, using design as a tool for advocacy, awareness, and social dialogue.

Pioneering Social Advocacy through Innovative Graphic Design

Graphic design has evolved from mere aesthetics to a powerful medium for social advocacy. Iconic symbols throughout history have driven social movements, and today, the field is more influential than ever, especially with the prevalence of digital media. Fay Qiu, a New York-based designer, leverages this power to advocate for social causes, focusing on minorities, LGBTQ rights, and the Asian community. Her designs challenge societal norms and stimulate conversation and action. She's notably worked on projects like the 'Stand with Asian Americans' initiative and an LGBTQ publication, 'Frock Magazine,' using intentional design elements to resonate deeply with audiences. Additionally, Qiu launched Tang Ren, promoting Chinatown's culture, and collaborated on interactive, technology-integrated projects like 'Between Four Freedoms,' showcasing the future direction of graphic design. Her work illustrates how design can encapsulate emotions, narratives, and data, creating a profound connection with audiences and driving social change.

Post-Branding: Challenging Traditional Branding in the Age of Homogenization

Post-Branding: The Never Ending Race"" by Jason Grant and Oliver Vodeb critiques traditional branding as an ideological tool contributing to social ills and homogenization. They propose post-branding, focusing on transparency, participatory design, and diversity. However, the practicality of post-branding in commercial contexts is questioned, as it aligns more with activist and non-profit groups. The book offers insights but acknowledges the challenges of applying these ideals in a competitive commercial landscape.

Beyond 'Mystery House': The Impact and Legacy of Game Designer Roberta Williams

Roberta revolutionized computer games in 1980 with her first graphic computer game, ""Mystery House."" She introduced strong female characters and advanced graphics to video games, such as ""King's Quest"" and ""Phantasmagoria,"" which pushed the boundaries of gaming. It is often overstated that she is a feminist icon in technology, but her legacy and contributions to the industry are more complex than that.

<sirdonaldfrancesco015@gmail.com>,Nick Singh <hello@nicksingh.com>,slope NOT y-intercept 📈 [Career Advice],2023-12-05 20:17:04+05:30,"Tanishq grow your career in tech faster once you internalize this concept Tanishq – it's me Nick Singh, and I HAD to share with you this neat idea related to growing your technical skills and","Tanishq grow your career in tech faster once you internalize this concept
 Tanishq –
 it’s me Nick Singh, and I HAD to share with you this neat idea related to growing your technical skills and achieving success in your career:

Focus on slope NOT y-intercept.

Because a bit of slope can make up for a lot of y-intercept!
Said more simply, focus on how fast you are learning and improving (slope), rather than bemoaning where you started (y-intercept).

Sam Altman, founder & CEO of OpenAI (the company behind chatGPT), agrees:

This concept might seem obvious.

But, from having done 40+ talks at different universities & conferences around how to navigate the the data job hunt (https://ace-the-data-science-interview.teachable.com/?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=slope-not-yintercept) , the most popular questions I get are:

""I didn’t study CS in undergrad, what now?""
""I don’t have a Masters degree, what now?""
""I didn't do any internships, what now?""

Each time someone asks this type of question, I give a cheeky answer:


** Go Invent A Time Machine
------------------------------------------------------------

This focus on:

“I did XYZ non-optimal thing in my
career a while back, help me!”

always felt silly to me, hence my tongue-in-cheek answer of:

“go invent a time-machine to
fix your y-intercept problem”.

Unless you've got a time machine, the past remains the past, and I don’t really care what choices you made years ago since I can't change them.

Irrespective of your particular y-intercept issue, the path forward mostly remains the same.

That’s why I try to steer the convo towards growing as fast as we can (slope) so that the arc of time works its magic and that the high rate-of-progress makes up for any y-intercept issues.

That's why I care more about how going forward we’re going to quickly build kick-ass portfolio projects (https://www.nicksingh.com/posts/guide-to-creating-kick-ass-data-science-ml-portfolio-projects?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=slope-not-yintercept) .

How we’re going to efficiently become a SQL ninja (https://datalemur.com/sql-interview-questions?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=slope-not-yintercept) .

How we’re going to bootstrap our network via cold emails (https://ace-the-data-science-interview.teachable.com/courses/ace-the-data-job-hunt/lectures/41010979?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=slope-not-yintercept)  👇

** The Best Ways To Improve slope
------------------------------------------------------------
Now that you understand WHY slope matters, let’s discuss HOW to increase your slope.

The best piece of advice I can give you is to work on projects that are 70% easy, 30% hard.

I’ve found working on projects beats reading books or taking courses.

I've found that the 70% easy to 30% hard ratio is the optimal balance between challenging yourself and learning new things, but still not burning yourself out or getting frustrated with the overall project's difficulty.

Example: If you’re a Data Analyst skilled in Excel, and interested in learning ML, instead of trying to learn Python/Pandas/Stats/ML all at once from a textbook or course, just start by learning to do regression analysis in Excel (https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/linear-regression-analysis-excel/) .

This way you'll learn something new, but won't overwhelm yourself by trying to do too much at once.

Or maybe don't even worry about ML at all, and just focus on doing similar Excel workflows but now in SQL via this free SQL tutorial for Data Analysts & Data Scientists (https://datalemur.com/sql-tutorial?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=slope-not-yintercept) .
https://datalemur.com/sql-tutorial?utm_source=general_email_drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=slope-not-yintercept
Similarly, if you’re a Software Engineer/Data Scientist interested in learning how chatGPT works, don’t overwhelm yourself by reading complicated research papers on transformers models.

Instead, start small by watching this 2-hour video walk-through on building GPT (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy) from scratch made by Andrej Karpathy (led the Computer Vision team at Tesla Autopilot) and follow along on your own computer.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy
By building projects slightly at the edge of your comfort zone, you'll achieve a high growth rate and crush your technical and career goals.

Stay slope-y my friends,

The 'Winter Woodland Animals' stamp collection, a creative collaboration between Eight Hour Day and the USPS, is a testament to the serenity and beauty of nature. Each of the four Forever stamps showcases a North American woodland animal set against the stark yet enchanting winter landscape. Under the art direction of Antonio Alcalá, this collection encapsulates the quiet, calm and reflective spirit of the winter season. The designers, Katie Kirk and Nathan Strandberg of Eight Hour Day, bring their unique passion for creativity and nature to life in these stamps. As a project born out of a love for the natural world and its seasonal transformations, it reflects Katie's upbringing, influenced by art and science. These stamps, available online at USPS.com, are not just postage; they celebrate the winter's introspective beauty, a dream project realized, and a perfect example of art meeting functionality.

Visioning"" meetings. You know, the ones with more buzzwords than
action?

There’s been a major developmentin our campaign to get car companies to stop their huge data collection
programs.									

First, some background: Mozilla's *Privacy Not Included buyer's guide revealed
that popular global car brands— like Toyota, Chevrolet, Nissan, Kia, Volkswagen, Honda, Hyundai, Audi, and
more — are collecting, sharing, and in some cases selling your deeply personal data, including your genetic information and sexual activity. So far 34,975 of you signed our petition to demand accountability from the big car companies.									

Here’s what happened today:Citing Mozilla’s research exposing these concerning data collection practices,
U.S. Senator Ed Markey directly challenged the CEOs of many of the car companies
we researched.1The senator's detailed letters and specific questions on data collection in cars
means the car companies will have to respond publicly to the specific issues raised in
Mozilla's *Privacy Not Included buyer's guide.									

Will you sign our petition to say you stand against the collection of sensitive personal data – like your genetic information and sexual activity – by the big car companies? https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/7P~pJ3ea3YQW/WnRPTk5RVnBKMml6OS9rTldpZjFnMkJ2cFV5NEJzbVo0MVI4Zk1PMjVxeXRpK1R2UUZ3RkljeDA4OG44Z0hGWE9Kblo0SlhZRTl6eDJJanhUUnVmZTFtN2h1dG1UTG9YTVBGWEVOWWEwbzQ9S0/ The more people that sign our petition right now while attention is on the
issue, the more pressure we can build to get this technology regulated and
removed.									Sign Our Petition → https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/0d~WQ9kZ9zHY/WnRPTk5RVnBKMml6OS9rTldpZjFnMkJ2cFV5NEJzbVo0MVI4Zk1PMjVxeXRpK1R2UUZ3RkljeDA4OG44Z0hGWE9Kblo0SlhZRTl6eDJJanhUUnVmZTFtN2h1dG1UTG9YTVBGWEVOWWEwbzQ9S0/ 									 									

This major step forward happened because our Mozilla community took action to
demand accountability from these big car companies. The original research in
Mozilla’s report reached the U.S. government and sparked action. This is what
Sen. Markey's letter said:									

""... a recent report from Mozilla revealed unfettered data collection and
privacy intrusions across huge swaths of the automobile industry. These business
practices must end. In light of these concerning reports, I am writing to
request additional information about your company’s policies on data collection,
use, and disclosure.""									

This wouldn't have happened without all of us standing together to bring this
gross guzzling of our personal information to the attention of decision makers.
Thanks for everything you’ve done to drive this campaign forward.

ABOUT THIS WORKSHOP
 

WHEN?
Thursday, December 14th 9:00AM-4:00PM PST

WHAT YOU'LL LEARN
You’ll walk away from this workshop with actionable tactics for planning, executing, and maintaining a successful design system at your organization.

This workshop is for UX/UI/product/front-end designers, front-end developers, and really anyone responsible for the success of digital products.

WHAT YOU GET
This workshop will be a truly interactive experience—which means you’ll be getting the chance to ask Brad all your burning design systems questions, and get the feedback you’ve always wanted, live! Plus, if you have any questions or need clarification after the workshop, Brad is happy for you to get in touch!

As a bonus, you’ll be getting curated PDF takeaways that Brad has put together for this workshop, which you can keep and refer to. The PDFs will be packed with tools, articles, reading material and helpful resources. PLUS the workshop will be recorded and available for future viewing!

TOPICS COVERED

Selling Design Systems
We all know design systems and pattern libraries are great, but how do you get your clients, bosses, and teammates on board? Brad will make the business cases for design systems, and discuss tactics and tools for selling design systems to clients and stakeholders.

A Pattern-Based Process
Making modular interfaces requires massive shifts in our design and development process. Brad will discuss why front-end development is an essential part of the design process and demonstrate how tools like lo-fi sketches, style tiles, frontend workshop tools like Storybook and Pattern Lab, and others facilitate collaboration—and result in successful design systems.

Atomic Design Principles
Brad will cover core principles of modular UI interface design and introduce the atomic design methodology that helps connect your design system design/dev work to your actual product design/dev work.

Creating a rock-solid component library
The heart and soul of a successful design system is a component library that lives in code and directly powers an organization's software products. Brad will cover all that goes into creating a UI component library that's reusable, flexible, extensible, and easy to work with.

Anatomy of Effective Reference Website
A style guide reference website is the happy home for all a design system’s ingredients. A robust and well-presented reference site can help a design system truly take root at your organization.

Design System Maintenance
Like a fine wine, a design system should increase in value over time. Brad will discuss tactics and techniques like team structure, versioning, managing changes and additions to the system, communication strategies, and more to ensure your design system provides lasting value to your organization.

Startups' Secret Weapon:

The Pivotal Role of Product

Design in Market Success

 
 
In the dynamic world of startups, product design is crucial for success. It's not just about aesthetics; effective design significantly enhances user experience, boosts customer loyalty, and provides a competitive edge. A well-crafted product design, which is both user-friendly and visually appealing, not only attracts customers but also fosters trust and brand recognition, setting the foundation for a startup's growth and distinguishing it in the crowded marketplace.

Designing for Success: How Product Design Shapes Startup Futures

Product design in startups is more than just a superficial aspect; it's a strategic tool that profoundly impacts a business's trajectory. Good product design enhances user experience, making products more intuitive and enjoyable and fostering customer satisfaction and loyalty. This design-centric approach leads to more robust user engagement and retention, which is essential in building a loyal customer base. Aesthetically pleasing and functional product design is pivotal in differentiating a startup from its competitors, offering a unique identity in a saturated market.

Investing in thoughtful product design is more than just creating a good-looking product. It's about crafting an experience that resonates with users, building trust, and establishing a solid brand presence. For startups, this investment translates into increased market presence, customer loyalty, and long-term success in an ever-evolving business landscape.

Navigating the Design World: The Distinctive Realities of Corporate and Agency Settings

The design landscape within corporations and small agencies presents contrasting work environments and creative challenges. Designers encounter a more structured, process-driven atmosphere in corporate settings, often dealing with larger teams and projects. In contrast, small agencies offer a more vibrant, flexible approach with opportunities for direct impact and innovation.

This is Mark Surman. I'm the executive director and president of Mozilla
Foundation.									

In just a moment, I'm going to ask you to make a financial contribution to
Mozilla. But first, let me explain to you why making a donation today is so important.									

Today is Giving Tuesday – a global day of generosity, where millions of people
dig deep to donate to important causes. It’s a day that encourages us to help
create the future we want to see.									

For the last 25 years, the Mozilla community has come together to reclaim the
internet.We share a hope in a future in which irresponsible tech companies are held to
account. A future where our online privacy is respected. A future with
trustworthy AI. And a future where Mozilla continues to provide a platform for
action, ideas and responsible technology.									

No one individual, organisation or company can reclaim the internet on their
own. It will only happen if we act together.Mozilla is focused on just this: building the movement of people, organisations
and companies committed to reshaping how the internet impacts our lives.									

Now, here’s where I get to the ask that I mentioned before. We set an ambitious
goal of raising $250,000 USD in contributions from the Mozilla community by
midnight tonight. And as of right now, we are still a little short of that goal.
That is why I'm asking you directly:									

Will you donate $10 USD to Mozilla? Your gift today will help us reach our goal and build the movement to reclaim the internet. https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/pKA6Q9Py8RfG/bEtQZ2RlQm5DMFJ1Ykdsa3Exem9qM1BsN2hmdXp5TldrVzZraVZnODd6WjNCUHB3VUQwR25SdjBEYnJYdjVaM1hhTkxGMUFjNXBuRnFxbFRzTWY0cENiQ0dReHljRk1EbTJBME11aVY1dHM9S0/ 									 																		Donate Now → https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/yvVqJp7GxEFq/bEtQZ2RlQm5DMFJ1Ykdsa3Exem9qM1BsN2hmdXp5TldrVzZraVZnODd6WjNCUHB3VUQwR25SdjBEYnJYdjVaM1hhTkxGMUFjNXBuRnFxbFRzTWY0cENiQ0dReHljRk1EbTJBME11aVY1dHM9S0/ 									 																		

For so many of us, it can feel like we’ve lost control of how the internet
affects our lives. That’s why in 2024, we’ll be encouraging the Mozilla
community — and the whole world — to reclaim the internet by:									Choosing secure products that protect their privacy. People need to have the choice about what information they share, and the power to say if, how, and where that information can be used.										Taking action to challenge irresponsible tech companies. Few companies are motivated to simply do the right thing – the public must hold them accountable, and we are proud to be the platform where that happens.										Building a future where we protect the internet as a public resource – together.																		 									

All of this work is possible, but only if all of us in the Mozilla community can
come together. That’s why reaching our $250,000 USD goal by midnight tonight is
so important. That is why I am asking you directly:									

Please donate $10 USD to Mozilla. Your donation will help reach our goal tonight, build our movement to reclaim the internet, and create a better future online. https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/V70mH3bAy2T7/bEtQZ2RlQm5DMFJ1Ykdsa3Exem9qM1BsN2hmdXp5TldrVzZraVZnODd6WjNCUHB3VUQwR25SdjBEYnJYdjVaM1hhTkxGMUFjNXBuRnFxbFRzTWY0cENiQ0dReHljRk1EbTJBME11aVY1dHM9S0/ 																		Donate Now → https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/2d~8Qd8qXkF4/bEtQZ2RlQm5DMFJ1Ykdsa3Exem9qM1BsN2hmdXp5TldrVzZraVZnODd6WjNCUHB3VUQwR25SdjBEYnJYdjVaM1hhTkxGMUFjNXBuRnFxbFRzTWY0cENiQ0dReHljRk1EbTJBME11aVY1dHM9S0/ 																		 																		

I am so proud to be part of the Mozilla community, alongside you and millions of
others protecting the internet. Thank you for everything that you do.

Hey Tanish,

This is your last opportunity to hear about our Cyber Monday offer for
the Support Board Ultimate Package.

As I write this, we have just 3 lifetime upgrades for Support Board
remaining. By the time you open this email, they might have already been
claimed. It's now or never.

**Click here to secure your Support Board Ultimate Lifetime Upgrade!**

Let me underscore why you absolutely want to snag one of these final 3
lifetime upgrades:

Imagine these scenarios:

**Critical Customer Support Escalation:**You're managing your customer
support team during a busy period, and a critical issue arises that
requires immediate attention. With Support Board Ultimate, you could
effortlessly coordinate your team, escalate the issue, and provide a
swift resolution, ensuring customer satisfaction.

**E-commerce Sales Surge:** Your online store experiences a sudden surge
in sales during a flash sale. Support Board Ultimate enables you to
automate order confirmations, address customer inquiries in real-time
across multiple channels, and ensure a seamless shopping experience for
every customer.

**Small Business Expansion:** Your small business is expanding rapidly,
and you need to onboard new support agents quickly. With Support Board
Ultimate, you can add unlimited agents, provide training materials using
up to 10,000,000 characters for chatbot training, and ensure your team
is well-prepared to handle the influx of customer inquiries.

And many other similar scenarios...

In these moments, you'll undoubtedly wish you had seized the opportunity
to claim the Support Board Ultimate Package.

‍♂️ **Grab it now while you still can!**
‍♀️

But if you delay, it'll be too late.

Don't get me wrong - you can still sign up for Support Board later,
but it will come at a recurring price. If you want to secure the same
deal as our recurring users, paying a rock-bottom, one-time fee, then
you must act immediately.

**Click here to secure one of the last 3 Ultimate upgrades now!**

As you read this, these final 3 upgrades may already be gone. However,
if you click the link and find the upgrade button still active, consider
yourself fortunate.

Don't hesitate. This is your chance to prevent future regrets, save
hundreds of dollars in recurring fees, and eliminate the stress of

Hey Tanish,

I'll keep this short and sweet...

Out of the 25 additional 

**Support Board Ultimate lifetime upgrades** we released for Cyber
Monday, we're 

**now left with only 9**.

These last 9 upgrades are on the brink of being claimed, and they'll
likely be gone within the next few hours.

If you've been waiting for the perfect moment to seize this opportunity,
the time is now.

**Secure Your Support Board Ultimate Lifetime Upgrade Today!**

Let me emphasize - this deal will never resurface. It's a exclusive
opportunity, and this is your final opportunity to make it yours.

What's more, you have absolutely nothing to lose. Your purchase is
safeguarded by a 

**30-day money-back guarantee**.

By claiming your lifetime Ultimate upgrade, you're not saying ""YES"" -
you're saying ""MAYBE.""

If, within 30 days, you discover that the Support Board Ultimate Package
isn't everything we've promised and more, or if you find that it doesn't
suit your needs, you can simply reach out to us. We'll swiftly refund
every penny you've paid, and your account will revert back to your
current lifetime plan.

‍♂️**Don't hesitate - click here to secure your Support
Board Ultimate Lifetime Upgrade now! **

This is your moment. Don't let it slip away.

**Cheers,**

**Federico**

**Founder of Supportboar**

This collaboration spanned several months, resulting in a comprehensive set of characters, props, and patterns across many media. The project's scope encompassed the eye-catching limited edition packaging of the brand’s full skincare advent calendar.

Beyond the digital appearance, MadebyRadio's creative touch was evident in in-store window displays, enchanting looping animations for LED screens, and even uniquely designed wrapping paper and crochet gift bags. This extensive and diverse application of their designs demonstrates MadebyRadio’s versatility and ability to infuse the holiday essence in various forms, making Kiehls' holiday campaign a visually delightful and immersive experience.

People are no longer in control of the internet and how it affects their lives.
Instead, the digital world is built by big tech, for big tech – all for their
whims and profits.									

It doesn't have to be like this. A different future is possible. If people come
together, we can build a movement that will put the internet back in our hands. We can reclaim the internet.									

That's why we're setting an ambitious goal of raising $250,000 USD in grassroots donations from the
Mozilla communityby the end of the day Tuesday, which is ""Giving Tuesday"" – the biggest day of
support for nonprofit organisations around the world.									

Thank you for being a part of the Mozilla community. I'm writing to you today to
ask if you can make a contribution to Mozilla today to kick off our goal of
raising $250,000 USD by Tuesday at midnight.									

Will you make a contribution of $10 to Mozilla today to build our movement to reclaim the internet? https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/LaKZCm4WDbMk/cmpJNHMvcy96cm1NQ1hlQ0xaTnZwUCthOTZXdC9PcEZyeWd2VDh5UWswR1lGaEt6Rit5emJ0a3k0MnVXOVQrUjlrR1d6Y2xSVEZYR1RNZEpwQUowR1V3RjRqL1F0MUFGL2tIT3VHTkZKZnc9S0/ 									Donate $10 Now → https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/8P~_J-XgyRcG/cmpJNHMvcy96cm1NQ1hlQ0xaTnZwUCthOTZXdC9PcEZyeWd2VDh5UWswR1lGaEt6Rit5emJ0a3k0MnVXOVQrUjlrR1d6Y2xSVEZYR1RNZEpwQUowR1V3RjRqL1F0MUFGL2tIT3VHTkZKZnc9S0/ 									 																		I’ll donate another amount  → https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/xdAYQ7e3avBV/cmpJNHMvcy96cm1NQ1hlQ0xaTnZwUCthOTZXdC9PcEZyeWd2VDh5UWswR1lGaEt6Rit5emJ0a3k0MnVXOVQrUjlrR1d6Y2xSVEZYR1RNZEpwQUowR1V3RjRqL1F0MUFGL2tIT3VHTkZKZnc9S0/ 									 																		

At Mozilla, we want to see a future where the internet remains a public resource
that is open and accessible to us all.That was our mission when the Mozilla Foundation was founded, and it is our
mission today – a vision made only more important as big tech companies and
their economic power are increasingly concentrated in the hands of just a few.									

We know that raising $250,000 USD in grassroots donations by the end of the day
Tuesday is an ambitious goal, but Mozilla has ambitious plans for 2024. We’ll be
supercharging our advocacy, research and community building programs, by
doubling down on some of things that Mozilla does best:									Our hard-hitting campaigns to take back the internet, by rallying people (like you!) to speak truth to power.										Our research to expose irresponsible tech, by helping shoppers to make better choices and forcing tech companies to do better.										By exposing where and when your privacy has been harmed and holding those responsible to account.																		 									

The Mozilla community has the strength to take on massive tech platforms and
governments – and win. We’ve proven it time and time again. Here’s a just a few
of the wins we’ve had just this year alone:																		YouTube announced it would share data with researchers, allowing us to better understand how YouTube's algorithm works and how we can stop the platform from recommending dangerous and harmful content – a change that came following years of campaigning, research and policy advocacy by Mozilla.										Slack was pressured by Mozilla and allies to commit to adding one of the most basic messaging features: a block button, which was an important step forward in dealing with abuse on the platform.										Car brands have been forced to respond and defend themselves when Mozilla exposed how their cars are collecting and using your deeply personal data.										The French Government wanted to introduce browser-level censorship (contained within the so-called ""SREN"" bill), which threatened to set a dangerous precedent for authoritarian governments. Fortunately, Mozilla’s tireless advocacy forced this bill to be revised to drop brower-level censorship, with a lawmaker even crafting the ‘Mozilla Amendment’. While it's still not officially passed, we're very hopeful about its prospects.									 									

We can keep winning, but it starts with people. People like you. And with your
support, we can raise $250,000 USD for Giving Tuesday just from our Mozilla
community.									

Contribute $10 to Mozilla today to build our movement to reclaim the internet. Your gift will help reach our ambitious goal before our Tuesday deadline. https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/YWg8BZ4NWmHD/cmpJNHMvcy96cm1NQ1hlQ0xaTnZwUCthOTZXdC9PcEZyeWd2VDh5UWswR1lGaEt6Rit5emJ0a3k0MnVXOVQrUjlrR1d6Y2xSVEZYR1RNZEpwQUowR1V3RjRqL1F0MUFGL2tIT3VHTkZKZnc9S0/ 									Donate $10 Now → https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/zdjEQR9qVAFG/cmpJNHMvcy96cm1NQ1hlQ0xaTnZwUCthOTZXdC9PcEZyeWd2VDh5UWswR1lGaEt6Rit5emJ0a3k0MnVXOVQrUjlrR1d6Y2xSVEZYR1RNZEpwQUowR1V3RjRqL1F0MUFGL2tIT3VHTkZKZnc9S0/ 																		 																		

Together, we can build a movement capable of taking on irresponsible big tech
companies – and winning. I am so proud to be a part of this community, alongside
you and millions of others fighting to reclaim the internet.									

Thank you for everything that you do for the internet,

Hey Tanish,

Just a few days ago, we unveiled an extraordinary Black Friday deal that
allowed you...

To upgrade your Support Board account to the 

**Ultimate lifetime plan** by paying a modest price. 

The response was incredible, and we completely sold out of the initial
50 Ultimate lifetime upgrades.

In fact, on Friday evening, I personally sent out a message stating that
there wouldn't be another chance to grab this exceptional offer. 

**And I meant every word.**

But something remarkable happened afterward. My inbox was inundated with
messages from people who, amidst the whirlwind of other Black Friday
deals, missed out on this incredible opportunity.

To all of you who reached out, I want you to know that I've been
listening attentively.

I've had discussions with my team, and here's the update:

**The Black Friday offer has officially ended, and it won't be coming
back.**We simply cannot extend it further, as it exceeded our original
limits.

However, in the spirit of Cyber Monday, I've got a twist for you that I
think you'll love.

Here's the scoop:

**We're releasing an additional 25 lifetime upgrades for the Support
Board Ultimate Package.**

Given the overwhelming demand we've witnessed, I anticipate these will
vanish in the blink of an eye.

But remember, it's just these 25 extras, and they're expected to be
snapped up in no time.

 **Secure Your Ultimate Lifetime Upgrade Now!**


This is your moment, and I want to emphasize that there will be no
extensions or exceptions. 

If you missed out last time, here's your chance to join the fortunate
few. And to make the deal even sweeter, we're offering a 30-day
money-back guarantee for your peace of mind.

**Don't hesitate - act swiftly and seize this Cyber Monday
opportunity**
.

**Cheers,**

**Federico**

**Founder of Supportboar**

Practice Fermi Estimates 2. Master XFN Jargon 3. Remove Uhms Tanishq
 Tanishq –
 I've got 3 stupidly low-effort ways for you to come across as smarter when at work, or during a job interview.

When I worked at Facebook and Google, these tactics helped me impress my co-workers, and I'm sure they'll help you too!


** Hack 1: Ace Fermi Estimates
------------------------------------------------------------

People will think you have superpowers if your great at back-of-the-envelope calculations.

Trust me, you'll impress everyone in the room when you quickly ballpark how many servers you might need to support a new feature, or on the fly calculate the Total-Addressable-Market (TAM) for some new product.

Here's a clever example of Fermi Estimation (https://brilliant.org/wiki/fermi-estimate/#:~:text=A%20Fermi%20estimate%20is%20one,or%20experimentation%20to%20determine%20exactly.)  in practice:
I know, fermi estimation seems like black magic, but knowing your numbers and making educated guesses are learnable skills.

How To Get Better, Quickly:

Software Engineers & Data Scientists, read this article by Jeff Dean (he leads Google's entire AI division): Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know (http://brenocon.com/dean_perf.html) .

This infographic should be helpful too:

Non-technical people, read the article “Statistics for Case Interviews (https://managementconsulted.com/statistics-to-know-for-case-interview/) ”.

Everyone, regardless of their role, should also know:
* how many customers your company has
* the average revenue & profit per customer
* how often customers perform core actions (example: at Facebook, how often does a typical user login, post, or send a friend request?)

Knowing your numbers is an easy way to look and BE smarter.

Conversely, not having number sense is an instant credibility killer.

I had a grown adult, born and raised in the good ol’ USA, seriously tell me the population of America was 1 billion people – huuuuge red flag 🚩🚩🚩



** Hack 2: Learn Your XFN Partner's Jargon
------------------------------------------------------------

Another smartness hack is to understand what your cross-functional (XFN) partners do, and be able to speak their language.

With marketers, mention how your work improves LTV:CAC (https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/cac-ltv-ratio/#:~:text=LTV%20stands%20for%20%E2%80%9Clifetime%20value,cost%20of%20acquiring%20that%20customer.) .
With PMs, explain why your feature benefits the ICP (https://www.leadfeeder.com/blog/saas-lead-generation-create-ideal-customer-profile/) .
With sales, spell out why your project drives more PQLs (https://productled.com/blog/product-qualified-leads) .

By speaking in terms your XFN partners understand and use, you'll earn the respect of stakeholders, and start to get higher-level, more complex projects, which is exactly the type of work you need to tackle to get promoted faster 🚀

Another advantage to becoming a generalist: by knowing keywords and concepts from other disciplines, you’ll be able to passively absorb more information, because previously unintelligible conversations and memos will start to “click”.

This kicks-off a self-reinforcing feedback loop, where the more you understand what everyone is working on, the more XFN responsibility you'll get, which leads to acquiring even more generalist knowledge and being put on even more important projects.

How To Become A Generalist, Quickly:

For technical people who want a crash-course in business jargon, go read “The Personal MBA (https://amzn.to/3JqqRmb) ” – it covers the fundamentals of marketing, sales, finance, and business systems.

I also like reading interview prep books (https://twitter.com/NickSinghTech/status/1617422204026736641?s=20&t=EQmti4AbrQSKuab0tb4HAg)  as crash courses to other job functions and how they think.
https://www.acethedatascienceinterview.com/best-data-science-interview-books
If you're a software engineer, maybe try product design exercises (https://amzn.to/408Lp8O) to build UX/UI sensibilities.

If you're non-technical, maybe learn what the Data Science / AI people are up to by reading Ace the Data Science Interview (https://amzn.to/3kF79Fx) .

Listening to podcasts outside of your area-of-expertise can also be great way to become a generalist.



** Hack 3: Stop Saying Filler Words
------------------------------------------------------------

Stop saying filler words like “uhm” and “like” – these tank your perceived intelligence.

While preparing for my interview with Fox News, I learned an easy way to break this bad habit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy
The trick to remove filler words is to speak slower and pause more – not only will this add emphasis to your words, but often these filler words are just placeholders while your brain is thinking of what to say next.

By talking slower, and being comfortable with small pauses, you naturally won’t reach for “uhm” and “like” as much in conversation.

Hope these tips help!

p.s. your perceived smartness is just one element that's being judged during a behavioral interview.

Companies are also testing your oral communication skills, and trying to determine how passionate you are about the position/company/products & industry.

After a long and excellent ride, the much-loved py2neo, which bridged graph thinking with Pythonic principles, has come to an end by the decision of its creator and maintainer, Nigel Small. The py2neo GitHub project has moved to neo4j-contrib/py2neo but is no longer maintained. Marius Conjeaud guides you through migrating your data from py2neo to the official driver.

Corey Lanum provides a hands-on approach to working with DateTime data with Neo4j. To demonstrate, he uses the astronaut database from Supercluster. It lists every human who has ever been to space, starting with Yuri Gagarin in 1961 and ending with the astronauts in space right now.

Nathan Smith explains how to work with the K-medoids algorithm to discover data clusters. It assigns nodes to a cluster based on the shortest path to a medoid. The algorithm optimises the selection of medoids to create the shortest total distance from nodes in the graph to their nearest medoid.

Hey Tanish,

We kicked off our exclusive Black Friday promotion for the 

**Support Board Ultimate Package**, and it's already causing a buzz!

Out of the initial 50 lifetime upgrades we allocated, 

**only 33 remain**. The clock is ticking, and these coveted upgrades are
disappearing fast.

**Don't wait - upgrade to the Support Board Ultimate Package
now!**  

Why the urgency? Allow me to refresh your memory:

Support Board has been a customer favorite on AppSumo, amassing a lot of
rave reviews during a brief period. It's not just another customer
support tool - it's the ultimate solution for transforming your
support and business operations.

One of its standout features is the ability to effortlessly handle
customer inquiries across various channels, including WhatsApp,
Messenger, Telegram, Email, and SMS. It's a game-changer for businesses
like yours.

Imagine scaling your support team with unlimited agents, personalizing
customer interactions with up to 10,000,000 characters for chatbot
training, and enjoying premium support whenever you need it.

But don't just take my word for it. Here's what one of our satisfied
AppSumo customers had to say:

**Claim Your Ultimate Lifetime Upgrade Now**

Whether you're in customer support, eCommerce, or run a small business,
Support Board has you covered.

This offer is as rare as it gets. With only 33 upgrades remaining, you
need to act swiftly to secure this incredible deal.

‍♂️ **Secure your Support Board Ultimate Package now and enjoy
lifetime access by paying only the minimal price difference from your
current plan. Say goodbye to recurring fees!**
‍♀️

Remember, once these Ultimate lifetime upgrades are gone, they won't be
coming back. Seize this opportunity before it slips away.

**Best regards,**

**Federico**

**Founder of Supportboard**

Hey Tanish,

The moment you've been waiting for has arrived! Our Early Black Friday
deal for the Support Board Ultimate Package is officially live.

 **Upgrade to the Support Board Ultimate Package now!**


This isn't just your ordinary Black Friday offer - it's your
opportunity to secure a lifetime of access to the most advanced customer
support and automation package at an unbeatable, one-time price.

**Let me break it down for you:**

With the 

**Support Board Ultimate Package**, you'll get:

✅ All the features you love from Support Board.

✅ A massive 200,000 monthly messages allowance.

✅ Unlimited agents to supercharge your support team.

✅ Up to 10,000,000 characters for chatbot training, ensuring
unparalleled personalization.

✅ Premium support to address your needs promptly.

✅ Complete access to all supported apps.

✅ The option for White Label to brand it as your own.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

 Imagine effortlessly handling customer support across WhatsApp,
Messenger, Telegram, Email, and SMS.

 Picture scaling your business with unlimited agents and top-notch
automation.

 Visualize training your chatbot to deliver hyper-personalized
interactions.

 Envision having premium support at your fingertips whenever you
need it.

 Consider having all your supported apps seamlessly integrated into
a single, cohesive platform.

 Contemplate the possibility of white-labeling to establish your
brand identity.

Now, let's talk about the deal itself:

While each of the incredible features listed above could easily warrant
a high-value recurring product, our special Black Friday offer allows
you to upgrade to the Support Board Ultimate Package by paying only a
small price.

But here's the catch - we've set aside only 

**50 lifetime upgrades** for this offer. Once they're claimed, they're
gone for good.

**Don't miss out on this golden opportunity!**

‍♂️ **Grab your Support Board Ultimate Package now and secure
your lifetime access!**

The only way you can lose is if you let this incredible deal slip
through your fingers.

**Best regards,**

**Federico**

What is high-accuracy mode?

High-accuracy mode gives better results when adding columns and extracting data. In our testing, high-accuracy mode had about 1/2 the error rate of standard columns. High-accuracy mode is particularly useful for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

High-accuracy mode is only available to Elicit Plus subscribers, and costs about 250 credits per answer.

Learn more about high-accuracy mode here ( https://support.elicit.com/en/articles/597825 ).

Improvements

As of today, we're using a new technique for high-accuracy mode. Our testing found that our new technique reduces the error rate by about 8% compared to our old technique.

Our new technique is also much faster -- it used to take about 25 seconds to get a high-accuracy mode answer, now it takes only about 4 seconds. I hope that this speed-up will let you iterate faster and complete your research projects more quickly!

Best,

Ben

The Role of Design and Content in eCommerce Conversions
The Role of Design and

Content in eCommerce

Conversions

The rise of visual commerce in online retail emphasizes creating an immersive shopping experience through high-quality imagery, videos, and interactive tools like augmented reality. This approach helps bridge the gap between online and in-store shopping by giving customers a realistic view of products in context, boosting their confidence to purchase. Incorporating 360-degree views, personalized experiences, and high-impact videos has become crucial for retailers to differentiate themselves and increase conversion rates.

Visual Commerce: The Impact of Design and Content on Online Shopping

Visual commerce transforms online retail by simulating in-store experiences through advanced design and content. This strategy involves presenting products in context using images, videos, augmented reality, and CGI, which helps customers visualize products in their lives, increasing their likelihood of purchasing. Interactive features like modular configurations, augmented reality, and personal shopping experiences are becoming essential for retailers to stand out. For instance, Visualsoft's collaborations with various sectors demonstrate the effectiveness of visual commerce in enhancing user engagement and fostering brand loyalty. The integration of tools allowing customers to upload personal photos for a customized view has significantly increased conversion rates.

Retailers are also shifting towards unique website designs with engaging video content and lifestyle imagery to create a distinctive and engaging user experience. The future of visual commerce, focusing on personalized customer experiences and leveraging AI, holds promising potential for further growth and innovation in online retail.

###Restricting Generative AI Use of Free Models


Earlier this year, we [introduced the NoAI tag](https://r.email1.sketchfab.com/mk/cl/f/sh/28xHLtxYQ51g5eDW2thFtSx07XtAbwbNOk/xTiyLlHLJqDJ), which indicates to generative AI programs that a particular model is not to be used for generative AI data collection. We did this to give creators more control over how their work is used.

Previously, using a Creative Commons (“CC”) license was the only way to distribute models for free on Sketchfab, so applying the NoAI tag to free content could only be done under a CC license. Now, we’ve expanded our Standard License so the NoAI tag can be applied to both free and paid models under our Standard License.


**Why we are doing this?**
--------------------------
If a creator applies the NoAI tag to a model they’ve made available under a Creative Commons license, the tag may not be enforceable outside of the Sketchfab platform. This means that for CC-licensed work, the NoAI tag might not be respected because the CC license may allow use of the work by generative AI programs regardless of the tag. This is due to [the way CC licenses work](https://r.email1.sketchfab.com/mk/cl/f/sh/28xHLtxYQ52CGEseoQtsPw5aYSB2BtRSpm/mJ4757uBxx1G) and is not something Sketchfab can control. Read more about that in [our Help Center article](https://r.email1.sketchfab.com/mk/cl/f/sh/28xHLtxYQ52iQpXnZy6UwPEAzMStlqHYGo/GHO237cbhAqf) and [this CC blog](https://r.email1.sketchfab.com/mk/cl/f/sh/28xHLtxYQ53EbQCwLVJ7SsMlQGklLn7dhq/M6nSIhgCxrV0).

After confronting AI companies who scraped Sketchfab, it became clear that uncertainties in copyright law make it difficult for both Sketchfab and creators to enforce NoAI restrictions on CC-licensed content. To address this issue while still honoring creators’ intent, we have expanded our Standard License to include free models.


**How using the Standard License offers more control over your work**
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting today, creators can distribute free models under our [Standard License](https://r.email1.sketchfab.com/mk/cl/f/sh/8qyleR3u7gYC13qToFY8vkKnIVIw7RwHprO/Ln1rzSTvihfW) and apply the NoAI tag to contractually prohibit use of their model for generative AI data collection. The NoAI tag remains contractually enforceable on Standard-licensed models once they have been downloaded from Sketchfab. We have introduced this additional contractual provision so that creators have a more certain way to take action against AI data collection if the NoAI restrictions applied to their content are violated.

The Standard License allows 3D assets to be used worldwide, on all types of media, for all types of use (whether commercial and non-commercial), in all types of derivative works. No credit needs to be given to the original creator. The Standard License is non-exclusive and royalty-free.

If you would like to have NoAI restrictions added to your free-to-download models, consider relicensing your existing CC-licensed models under the Standard License. If you take no action, the settings on your models will remain the same and only the CC license terms (not the Sketchfab Terms of Service which govern the use of the NoAI tag) will apply to further distribution of your model outside the Sketchfab platform.

Starting today, you will no longer be able to apply the NoAI tag to new uploads of CC-licensed content due to the uncertainty around the tag’s enforceability outside of Sketchfab.

*Note: Neither Sketchfab nor Epic Games has any agreements with companies allowing them to use content on our websites in datasets for, in the development of, or as inputs to generative AI programs, and under our*[*Terms of Use*](https://r.email1.sketchfab.com/mk/cl/f/sh/8qyleR3u7gaKqnEM0WeFzoeFjbihLstMHTe/mMe02Ytqszy5)*we aren’t allowed to do this.*

Amazon's Alexa is getting a new boss. Let's ask him to protect children's privacy in Amazon devices https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/-Z~dQLxp2WFP/WFpqa1dUb3BOVkJnS080MnJhUENNQmhBb1FWTmZTQVZ0L3ZzYlBzdlhIV2daWWZPR0xaVG5QNG1oSk9YckZIeU5nb0JxT0ZKT1d4NjgxUllVNGpCMnVrSVQvWnBSOWQwTkQweWxicEx4UnM9S0/.									

A new executive is coming in to lead Amazon's Devices & Services division, which
includes Alexa, Echo, Ring Video Doorbells, Fire TV, Fire tablets, Kindles, and other devices and ""smart"" home products. And we think he needs to make
protecting people’s privacy a top priority.									

That has to start with children’s privacy. Amazon has agreed to pay a $25 million USD fine to U.S. regulators for keeping
Alexa recordings of children's voices and geolocation data indefinitely - in
some cases even after parents had asked for them to be deleted. With smart home
devices, e-readers, and tablets geared towards kids, Amazon's ability to mine
children’s personal data is a big problem.									

This is not acceptable, and we need to make sure we send a strong message to the
new Amazon leadership: Children’s privacy needs to be protected in all Amazon
devices.									

Sign Mozilla’s petition now and tell Amazon's new executive to protect children’s privacy in Amazon devices! https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/zdjEQR9kw3Qy/WFpqa1dUb3BOVkJnS080MnJhUENNQmhBb1FWTmZTQVZ0L3ZzYlBzdlhIV2daWWZPR0xaVG5QNG1oSk9YckZIeU5nb0JxT0ZKT1d4NjgxUllVNGpCMnVrSVQvWnBSOWQwTkQweWxicEx4UnM9S0/ 									Sign the Petition  → https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/N-x4cvg-6pF~/WFpqa1dUb3BOVkJnS080MnJhUENNQmhBb1FWTmZTQVZ0L3ZzYlBzdlhIV2daWWZPR0xaVG5QNG1oSk9YckZIeU5nb0JxT0ZKT1d4NjgxUllVNGpCMnVrSVQvWnBSOWQwTkQweWxicEx4UnM9S0/ 																		 									

The online shopping giant has never been good at respecting consumers’ privacy.
In Mozilla's *Privacy Not Included holiday shopping guide we published last week, Amazon tops our worst-of list. They do a terrible job at respecting and protecting our privacy on multiple
fronts. And this is the absolute minimum of what Amazon needs to do immediately:									Do not retain voice recordings on Alexa for Kids and other products aimed at children, including audio files, transcripts and geolocation information by default										Honour parents’ requests to delete their children’s personal data										Identify and delete inactive child profiles									

Sign the petition now and ask Amazon to respect children’s privacy! https://links.email.mozilla.org/els/v2/rjAzQNvV02BN/WFpqa1dUb3BOVkJnS080MnJhUENNQmhBb1FWTmZTQVZ0L3ZzYlBzdlhIV2daWWZPR0xaVG5QNG1oSk9YckZIeU5nb0JxT0ZKT1d4NjgxUllVNGpCMnVrSVQvWnBSOWQwTkQweWxicEx4UnM9S0/ 									

Now that there's a new leader for the Amazon products that go into peoples'
homes, there are big windows of opportunity for:									The new leader of Amazon's hardware division, who can fix the worst privacy problems and start his tenure by showing us that privacy is something Amazon cares about;										Amazon employees, who want to make their products less creepy;										Consumers, who can ask for products that respect everyone’s privacy starting immediately with children.									

Mozilla has been keeping a close eye on Amazon, from reviewing Amazon's products in our buyer's guide for the last six years,
to exposing security issues with Amazon Ring, or the company’s excessive data
sharing with law enforcement. Our Amazon privacy wish list is long, starting
with securing common sense privacy features in kids products.									

We need to keep holding Amazon accountable, and Mozilla supporters across the
world can help. Together, let’s seize this rare opportunity to drive real change in Amazon's
business practices and make sure it keeps its hands off children's personal data.

Tanishq Khandelwal <sirdonaldfrancesco015@gmail.com>,"""Christoph C. Cemper (AIPRM)"" <hello@mailing.aiprm.com>",Tanishq are you worried about ChatGPT going away? Here's what AIPRM has for you.,2023-11-21 19:19:06+05:30,"Meet AIPRM Cockpit! Meet AIPRM Cockpit! Hey Tanishq Unless you've been living under a rock, you've witnessed the highly concerning and unprofessional activities of OpenAI in the last days.","Meet AIPRM Cockpit!

Meet AIPRM Cockpit!

Hey Tanishq

Unless you've been living under a rock, you've witnessed the
highly concerning and unprofessional activities of OpenAI in the
last days.

Rightfully, one has to ask - will ChatGPT continue to function?

Will they be able to operate?

Regardless of the lip service of some individuals, we're serious
about it here at AIPRM.

Personally I see it going dark or experience massive outages
soon.

Why I think so? If they had stability and performance problems in
""good times"" what will happen with the chaos of the mass exodus
now?

""So what's the plan then Christoph?"", you ask Tanishq?

The plan is almost done!

AIPRM has been working on AIPRM Cockpit for close to four months.

It's also called ""Project Independence"" internally.

AIPRM Cockpit is like ChatGPT, without relying on ChatGPT!

AIPRM Cockpit provides you

* all the public prompts you love,
* all the features and private prompts if you're a paying
customer,
* all the lists, features, favorites, variables
* all the benefits you love and use every day,
* and, of course, a ton of additional features,

AIPRM Cockpit works with multiple AIs independent of OpenAI. And
it still has all the power.

AIPRM Cockpit works with an OpenAI key and a custom Llama
installation alike, for example.

AIPRM Cockpit is in the finishing development and QA stages, and
I cannot wait to give it to the first customers.

If you would like to be one of the first to use AIPRM Cockpit,
then please join this waiting list
by CLICKING HERE ( https://simplero.com/d/mlZ4l_eYwwgxm8gl/c/5177121/0 )

You can also give this link to your friends.

The Link to the Waiting List Signup. ( https://simplero.com/d/mlZ4l_eYwwgxm8gl/c/5177122/1 )

Don't miss this chance to become one of the first AIPRM Cockpit
users Tanishq!

Then you can tune back into the news feed to watch the craziest
spectacle I've experienced in my 30 years in tech.

We have a lot to launch, and we can and will launch it with or
without OpenAI - the options are limitless almost.

(and I haven't even told you everything we have in the pipeline!)

have a great day,

Christoph C. Cemper

Founder & CEO
and the team of
AIPRM

Build with the power of code — without writing any
Take control of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a visual canvas. Webflow generates clean, semantic code that’s ready to publish or hand to developers. Simply drag in unstyled HTML elements to build exactly what you want — then turn footers, nav bars, and more into components you can reuse. Next, take full control of CSS properties and a class system that cascades changes across your site.
You design, we generate the code — for everything from fully custom layouts to complex animations.

Better summary of papers The summary now makes connections between papers, and it explains what the set of papers as a whole","We've added a better summary of papers and a support center to Elicit ( https://elicit.com/?workflow=table-of-papers )!

 

Better summary of papers

The summary now makes connections between papers, and it explains what the set of papers as a whole has to say about the research question.

 

 

For Elicit Plus users, the summary now includes the top 8 papers rather than just the top 4. (You can subscribe to Elicit Plus on your settings page ( https://elicit.com/settings ).)

The new summary uses Factored Verification, a technique developed by our machine learning team, to reduce hallucination. Factored Verification makes it more likely that the summary accurately reports what is in the papers. You can read more about Factored Verification in our paper ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10627.pdf )!

I hope that the improved summary helps you answer simple questions quickly, and navigate the research literature around more complex questions more easily.

 

Support center

In our new support center ( https://support.elicit.com/ ), you can learn how to make the best use of Elicit, find answers to frequently asked questions, and more!

 

Best,
Ben

At Neo4j, we’ve been working on making the Cypher types visible in the Cypher language. This includes seeing what type a value has with the type predicate expression and valueType function. It also applies to introducing type constraints, which let you restrict types allowed to be stored under a property. Nadja Müller explores what you can do with this new functionality.

In case you missed it - we built the AIPRM Community GPT
directory, and it’s live right inside AIPRM.

You can

* Find new GPTs by powerful searches you know from AIPRM
* Filter and Sort by Popularity

* Vote on GPTs

* and of course use all the AIPRM prompts you love and use every
day with every GPT.

Here is the next step - linking a prompt to a GPT.

…in another sneak preview video I made for you.

Quick Demo of GPT Specific Prompts in AIPRM (
https://simplero.com/d/i9sflISDcMK2Sx9n/c/5162397/0 )

You will get access to this in your AIPRM in Chrome or Edge. (
https://simplero.com/d/i9sflISDcMK2Sx9n/c/5162398/1 )

Just make sure you have the most recent version installed from
here ( https://simplero.com/d/i9sflISDcMK2Sx9n/c/5162386/2 ).

(you can remove and reinstall if in doubt).

Here’s more on my profile on LinkedIn ( https://simplero.com/d/i9sflISDcMK2Sx9n/c/5162399/3 ) or
Twitter ( https://simplero.com/d/i9sflISDcMK2Sx9n/c/5162400/4 ) or the YouTube link above.

(of course, I appreciate you spreading the word, too - by sharing
those).

That's it for today.

Stay tuned - the release version number for linking prompts to
GPTs will be 1.1.11.14 or higher...

Talk soon,

Christoph C. Cemper
and the team of
AIPRM

PS: don't forget to always use the most recent version of AIPRM (
